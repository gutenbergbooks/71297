  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I have endeavoured to make this book useful to more than
one class of readers. It is written primarily for the use of
those students of the law who are desirous of laying a scientific
foundation for their legal education; yet I hope that it will
not be found destitute of interest by those lawyers whose
academic studies lie behind them, but who have not wholly
ceased to concern themselves with the theoretical and scientific
aspects of the law. Further, a great part of what I have
written is sufficiently free from the technicalities and details
of the concrete legal system to serve the purposes of those
laymen who, with no desire to adventure themselves among
the repellent mysteries of the law, are yet interested in those
more general portions of legal theory which touch the problems
of ethical and political science.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be noticed that occasional passages of the text are
printed in smaller type. These are of lesser importance, of
greater difficulty, or of a controversial or historical character,
and are not essential to the continuity of the exposition.</p>

<p class='c006'>Certain parts of this book have already been published in
the Law Quarterly Review, and I have also incorporated in it
the substance of a much smaller work published by me some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>years ago under the title of “The First Principles of Jurisprudence.”
I have not thought it necessary to allude in the
text to certain discrepancies in matters of detail between my
earlier and later views, and it will be understood that the
present work wholly supersedes the earlier, as containing a
re-statement of the substance of it in a more comprehensive
form.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='c013'>THE SCIENCE OF JURISPRUDENCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 1. <b>Jurisprudence as the Science of Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>In the widest of its applications the term jurisprudence
means the science of law, using the word law in that vague
and general sense in which it includes all species of obligatory
rules of human action. Of jurisprudence in this sense, there
are as many divisions as there are kinds of law which have
been deemed sufficiently important and well developed to
serve as the subject-matter of distinct branches of learning.
They are at least three in number:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>Civil Jurisprudence.</em>—This is the science of civil law,
that is to say, the law of the land. Its purpose is to give a
complete and systematic account of that complex body of
principles which is received and administered in the tribunals
of the state.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>International Jurisprudence.</em>—This is the science of
international law or the law of nations. It is concerned not
with the rules which are in force <em>within</em> states, but with those
which prevail <em>between</em> states. Just as the conduct of the
subjects of a single state is governed by the civil law, so
international law regulates the conduct of states themselves
in their relations towards each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>Natural Jurisprudence.</em>—This is the science of that
which our forefathers termed natural law or the law of nature
(<i><span lang="la">jus naturale</span></i>). By this they meant the principles of natural
justice—justice as it is in itself, in deed and in truth, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>contrasted with those more or less imperfect and distorted
images of it which may be seen in civil and international law.
Whether these principles of natural justice are rightly entitled
to the name of law—whether natural law, so called, can
be rightly classed along with civil and international law as a
species of the same genus—is a question which it is not needful
for us here to discuss. It is sufficient for our present purpose
to note the historical fact, that there is a very extensive
literature in which the law of nature is given a place side by
side with civil law and the law of nations (<i><span lang="la">jus naturale</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">jus
civile</span></i>, and <i><span lang="la">jus gentium</span></i>), and in which the resulting threefold
division of jurisprudence into natural, civil, and international,
is recognised as valid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Books of natural jurisprudence are in their essence books
of ethics or moral philosophy, limited, however, to that department
which is concerned with <em>justice</em>, as opposed to the
other forms of right, while the method and the point of view
are those of the lawyer rather than of the moral philosopher.
Experience has shown, however, that this abstract theory
of justice in itself, this attempt to work out <i><span lang="la">in abstracto</span></i> the
principles of natural right, is a sufficiently unprofitable form
of literature. In England both name and thing have become
in recent years all but obsolete. Yet there are not wanting
even at this day examples of the earlier way of thought. The
most notable of these is the late Professor Lorimer’s <em>Institutes
of Law, a Treatise of the Principles of Jurisprudence as determined
by Nature</em>. On the Continent, on the other hand, the
literature of natural law, though no longer as flourishing as it
was, is still of importance. One of the best known works of
this class is Ahrens’ <i><span lang="fr">Cours de Droit Naturel</span></i>. A typical example
from an earlier epoch is Pufendorf’s once celebrated
but now neglected work, <i><span lang="la">De Jure Naturae et Gentium</span></i>
(1672).<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ 2. <b>Jurisprudence as the Science of Civil Law.</b></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In a second and narrower sense, jurisprudence, instead of
including all three of the foregoing divisions, is limited to one
only, namely, that which we have distinguished as civil. It
is the science of civil law. A similar specific application
belongs to the term law also, for when we speak of law without
any qualifying epithet, we commonly mean that particular
form which is administered in the tribunals of the
state. So when we speak of jurisprudence without more,
we usually intend the science of this special kind of law and
this alone.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Civil jurisprudence is divisible into three branches, which
may be distinguished as <em>Systematic</em>, <em>Historical</em>, and <em>Critical</em>.
The first deals with the present; its purpose is the exposition
of the legal system as it now is. The second deals with the
past; it is concerned with the legal system in the process of
its historical development. The third deals with the ideal
future; it expounds the law not as it is or has been, but as
it ought to be. Systematic jurisprudence is legal exposition;
historical jurisprudence is legal history; while critical jurisprudence
is commonly known as the science of legislation.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ 3. <b>Theoretical Jurisprudence.</b></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>There is yet a third and still narrower sense, in which jurisprudence
includes not the whole science of civil law, but only
a particular part of it. In this limited signification it may be
termed abstract, theoretical, or general, to distinguish it from
the more concrete, practical, and special departments of legal
study. It is with this form only that we are concerned in
the present treatise. How, then, shall we define it, and how
distinguish it from the residue of the science of the civil law?
It is <em>the science of the first principles of the civil law</em>. It is not
possible, indeed, to draw any hard line of logical division between
these first principles and the remaining portions of the
legal system. The distinction is one of degree rather than of
kind. Nevertheless it is expedient to set apart, as the subject-matter
of a special department of study, those more
fundamental conceptions and principles which serve as the
basis of the concrete details of the law. This introductory
and general portion of legal science, cut off for reasons of
practical convenience from the special portions which come
after it, constitutes the subject-matter of our inquiry. It
comprises the first principles of civil jurisprudence in all
its three divisions, systematic, historical, and critical. The
fact that its boundaries are not capable of being traced with
logical precision detracts in no degree from the advantages
to be derived from its recognition and separate treatment as
a distinct department of juridical science. Practical legal
exposition acknowledges no call to rise to first principles, or
to proceed to ultimate analysis. From the point of view of law
as an art, the importance of conceptions and principles varies
inversely with their abstractness or generality. Practical
jurisprudence proceeds from below upward, and ascends no
further than the requirements of use and practice demand.
Theoretical jurisprudence, on the contrary, attributes value
to the abstract and the general, rather than to the concrete
and the particular. Even when these two departments of
knowledge are coincident in their subject-matter, they are far
apart in their standpoints, methods, and purposes. The aim
of the abstract study is to supply that theoretical foundation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>which the <em>science</em> of law demands, but of which the art of law
is careless.</p>

<p class='c007'>Opinions may well differ to some extent as to the matters
which are fit, by reason of their generality or their theoretic
and scientific interest, to find a place among the contents of
abstract jurisprudence. Speaking generally, however, it
may be said that this science appropriately deals with such
matters as the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. An analysis of the conception of civil law itself, together
with an examination of the relations between this and other
forms of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. An analysis of the various subordinate and constituent
ideas of which the complex idea of the law is made up; for
example, those of the state, of sovereignty, and of the
administration of justice.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. An account of the sources from which the law proceeds,
with an investigation into the theory of legislation,
precedent, and customary law.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. An examination of the general principles of legal
development, as contrasted with the historic details of the
growth of the individual legal system, this last pertaining
to legal history.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. An inquiry into the scientific arrangement of the law,
that is to say, the logical division of the <i><span lang="la">corpus juris</span></i> into
distinct departments, together with an analysis of the distinctions
on which the division is based.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. An analysis of the conception of legal rights together
with the division of rights into various classes, and the general
theory of the creation, transfer, and extinction of rights.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. An investigation of the theory of legal liability, civil
and criminal.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. An examination of any other juridical conceptions which
by reason of their fundamental character, or their theoretical
interest, significance, or difficulty, deserve special attention
from the abstract point of view; for example, property,
possession, obligations, trusts, incorporation, and many
others.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>It may avoid misconceptions, and assist us in understanding
what theoretical jurisprudence <em>is</em>, if we state shortly
what it <em>is not</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. In the first place it is not an elementary outline of the
concrete legal system. It deals not with the outlines of the
law, but with its ultimate conceptions. It is concerned not
with the simplest and easiest, but with some of the most
abstruse and difficult portions of the legal system. Theoretical
jurisprudence is not elementary law, any more than
metaphysics is elementary science.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. In the second place it is not, as the name <em>general</em> jurisprudence
suggests, and as some writers have held,<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a> the
science of those conceptions and principles which all or most
systems of law have in common. It is true, indeed, that
a great part of the matter with which it is concerned is to
be found in all mature legal systems. All these have the
same essential nature and purposes, and therefore agree to
a large extent in their fundamental principles. But it is
not because of this universal reception, that such principles
pertain to theoretical jurisprudence. Were it a rule of every
country in the world that a man could not marry his deceased
wife’s sister, the rule would not for that reason be
entitled to a place in this department of legal science. Conversely,
as universal reception is not sufficient, so neither is
it necessary. Even if no system in the world, save that of
England, recognised the legislative efficacy of precedent, the
theory of case-law would none the less be a fit and proper
subject of the science in question.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Finally, this branch of knowledge has no exclusive
claim to the name of jurisprudence or of legal science. It
is not, as some say, the science of law, but is simply the
introductory portion of it. As we have already seen, it is not
even capable of definite and logical separation from the
residue of legal learning. The division is one suggested by
considerations of practical convenience, not demanded by
the requirements of logic.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>The divisions of legal science, as they have been stated
and explained in the foregoing pages, may be exhibited in

<h3 class='c017'>§ 4. <b>English and Foreign Jurisprudence.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The use of the term jurisprudence to indicate exclusively that special
branch of knowledge which we have termed theoretical jurisprudence, is a
peculiarity of English nomenclature. In foreign literature jurisprudence
and its synonyms include the whole of legal science and are never used in
this specific and limited signification. The foreign works which correspond
most accurately to the English literature of this subject are of three different
kinds:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Works devoted to the subject known as <cite>Juridical Encyclopædia</cite>,
one of the best known examples of which is that of Arndts. He defines
this department of legal science as comprising “a scientific and systematic
outline or general view of the whole province of jurisprudence (<i><span lang="de">Rechtswissenschaft</span></i>),
together with the general data of that science.” “Its
purpose,” he adds, “is to determine the compass and limits of jurisprudence,
its relations to other sciences, its internal divisions, and the mutual
relations of its constituent parts.”<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>2. Books of <i><span lang="nl">Pandektenrecht</span></i> (that is to say, Modern Roman Law), and
more especially the Introductory or General Part of these works. German
jurists have devoted extraordinary energy and acumen to the analysis
and exposition of the law of the Pandects, in that modern form in which
it was received in Germany until superseded by recent legislation. Much
of the work so done bears too special a reference to the details of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Roman system to be in point with respect to the theory of English law.
The more general portions, however, are admirable examples of the
scientific analysis of fundamental legal conceptions. Special mention
may be made of the unfinished <cite>System of Modern Roman Law</cite> by Savigny,
and of the similar works of Windscheid and Dernburg.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. A third form of foreign literature which corresponds in part to our
English books of jurisprudence, consists of those works of <i><span lang="la">jurisprudentia
naturalis</span></i> which have been already referred to. These contain the theory of
natural law and natural justice, while English jurisprudence is concerned
with civil law, and with the civil or legal justice which that law embodies.
Yet the relation between natural and civil law, natural and civil justice, is
so intimate that the theory of the one is implicitly, if not explicitly, that of
the other also. Widely, therefore, as they differ in aspect, we may place
the French <i><span lang="fr">Philosophie du droit naturel</span></i> and the German <i><span lang="de">Naturrechtswissenschaft</span></i>
side by side with our own theoretical jurisprudence. It is, indeed,
from the earlier literature of natural law, as represented by Pufendorf,
Burlamaqui, Heineccius, and others,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a> that the modern English literature
of jurisprudence is directly descended.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='c013'>CIVIL LAW.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 5. <b>The Definition of Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The law is the body of principles recognised and applied by
the state in the administration of justice. Or, more shortly:
The law consists of the rules recognised and acted on in
courts of justice.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be noticed that this is a definition, not of <em>a</em> law, but
of <em>the</em> law, and our first concern is to examine the significance
of this distinction. The term law is used in two senses, which
may be conveniently distinguished as the abstract and the
concrete. In its abstract application we speak of the law of
England, the law of libel, criminal law, and so forth. Similarly
we use the phrases law and order, law and justice, courts
of law. It is to this usage that our definition is applicable.
In its concrete sense, on the other hand, we say that Parliament
has enacted or repealed a law. We speak of the by-laws
of a railway company or municipal council. We hear of the
corn laws or the navigation laws. The distinction demands
attention for this reason, that the concrete term is not co-extensive
with the abstract in its application. Law or the
law does not consist of the total number of laws in force.
The constituent elements of which the law is made up are
not laws but rules of law or legal principles. That a will
requires two witnesses is not rightly spoken of as a law of
England; it is a rule of English law. A law means a statute,
enactment, ordinance, decree, or any other exercise of legislative
authority. It is one of the sources of law in the abstract
sense. A law produces statute law, just as custom produces
customary law, or as a precedent produces case-law.</p>

<p class='c007'>This ambiguity is a peculiarity of English speech. All the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>chief Continental languages possess distinct expressions for
the two meanings. Law in the concrete is <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr">loi</span></i>, <i><span lang="de">gesetz</span></i>,
<i><span lang="it">legge</span></i>. Law in the abstract is <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i>, <i><span lang="de">recht</span></i>, <i><span lang="it">diritto</span></i>. It is
not the case, indeed, that the distinction between these two
sets of terms is always rigidly maintained, for we occasionally
find the concrete word used in the abstract sense. Medieval
Latin, for example, constantly uses <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i> as equivalent to <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>,
and the same usage is not uncommon in the case of the
French <i><span lang="fr">loi</span></i>. The fact remains, however, that the Continental
languages possess, and in general make use of, a method of
avoiding the ambiguity inherent in the single English term.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most English writers have, in defining law, defined it in the
concrete, instead of in the abstract sense. They have
attempted to answer the question: “What is a law?” while
the true inquiry is: “What is law?” The central idea of
juridical theory is not <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i> but <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>, not <i><span lang="de">gesetz</span></i> but <i><span lang="de">recht</span></i>. To this
inverted and unnatural method of procedure there are two
objections. In the first place it involves a useless and embarrassing
conflict with legal usage. In the mouths of lawyers
the concrete signification is quite unusual. They speak
habitually of law, of the law, of rules of law, of legal principles,
but rarely of a law or of the laws. When they have occasion
to express the concrete idea, they avoid the vague generic
expression, and speak of some particular species of law—a
statute, Act of Parliament, by-law, or rule of Court. In the
second place, this consideration of laws instead of law tends
almost necessarily to the conclusion that statute law is the
type of all law and the form to which all of it is reducible in
the last analysis. It misleads inquirers by sending them to
the legislature to discover the true nature and origin of law,
instead of to the courts of justice. It is consequently responsible
for much that is inadequate and untrue in the
juridical theory of English writers.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 6. <b>The Administration of Justice.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We have defined law by reference to the administration of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>justice. It is needful, therefore, to obtain here some understanding
of the essential nature of that function of the state,
though a complete analysis of it must be deferred to a later
period of our inquiry. That some form of compulsion and
control is essential for the realization in human conduct of
the idea of justice, experience has made sufficiently manifest.
Unfortunately for the welfare of the world, men are not so
constituted that to know the right is to do it. In the nature
of things there is a conflict, partly real, partly only apparent,
between the interests of man and man, and between those of
individuals and those of society at large; and to leave every
man free to do that which is right in his own eyes, would
fill the world with fraud and violence. “We have seen,”
says Spinoza, at the commencement of his Treatise on
Politics,<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> “that the way pointed out by Reason herself is
exceeding difficult, insomuch so that they who persuade
themselves that a multitude of men&#160;... can be induced to
live by the rule of Reason alone, are dreamers of dreams and
of the golden age of the poets.” If, therefore, we would
maintain justice, it is necessary to add compulsion to instruction.
It is not enough to point out the way; it is needful to
compel men to walk in it. Hence the existence of various
regulative or coercive systems, the purpose of which is the
upholding and enforcement of right and justice by some
instrument of external constraint. One of the most important
of these systems is the administration of justice by
the state. Another is the control exercised over men by the
opinion of the society in which they live. A third is that
scheme of coercion established within the society of states for
the enforcement of the principles of international justice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The administration of justice may therefore be defined as
the maintenance of right within a political community by
means of the physical force of the state.</p>

<p class='c007'>The instrument of coercion employed by any regulative
system is called a sanction, and any rule of right supported
by such means is said to be sanctioned. Thus physical force,
in the various methods of its application, is the sanction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>applied by the state in the administration of justice. Censure,
ridicule, contempt, are the sanctions by which society
(as opposed to the state) enforces the rules of morality. War
is the last and the most formidable of the sanctions which in
the society of nations maintain the law of nations. Threatenings
of evils to flow here or hereafter from divine anger are
the sanctions of religion, so far as religion assumes the form
of a regulative or coercive system.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A sanction is not necessarily a punishment or penalty. To
punish wrongdoers is a very effectual way of maintaining the
right, but it is not the only way. We enforce the rule of right,
not only by imprisoning the thief, but by depriving him of his
plunder, and restoring it to its true owner; and each of these
applications of the physical force of the state is equally a sanction.
The examination and classification of the different
forms of sanction made use of by the state will claim our
attention in a later chapter on the administration of justice.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 7. <b>Law Logically Subsequent to the Administration of Justice.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We have defined law as the body of principles observed and
acted on by the state in the administration of justice. To
this definition the following objection may be made. It may
be said: “In defining law by reference to the administration
of justice, you have reversed the proper order of ideas, for
law is the first in logical order, and the administration of justice
second. The latter, therefore, must be defined by reference
to the former, and not <i><span lang="la">vice versa</span></i>. Courts of justice are
essentially courts of law, justice in this usage being merely
another name for law. The administration of justice is
essentially the enforcement of the law. The laws are the
commands laid by the state upon its subjects, and the law
courts are the organs through which these commands are
enforced. Legislation, direct or indirect, must precede
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>adjudication. Your definition of law is therefore inadequate,
for it runs in a circle. It is not permissible to say that the
law is the body of rules observed in the administration of
justice, since this function of the state must itself be defined
as the application and enforcement of the law.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This objection is based on an erroneous conception of
the essential nature of the administration of justice. The
primary purpose of this function of the state is that which
its name implies—to maintain right, to uphold justice, to
protect rights, to redress wrongs. Law is secondary and
unessential. It consists of the fixed principles in accordance
with which this function is exercised. It consists of the pre-established
and authoritative rules which judges apply in the
administration of justice, to the exclusion of their own free
will and discretion. For good and sufficient reasons the
courts which administer justice are constrained to walk in
predetermined paths. They are not at liberty to do that
which seems right and just in their own eyes. They are
bound hand and foot in the bonds of an authoritative creed
which they must accept and act on without demur. This
creed of the courts of justice constitutes the law, and so far as
it extends, it excludes all right of private judgment. The law
is the wisdom and justice of the organized commonwealth,
formulated for the authoritative direction of those to whom
the commonwealth has delegated its judicial functions. What
a litigant obtains in the tribunals of a modern and civilized
state is doubtless justice according to law, but it is essentially
and primarily justice and not law. Judges are appointed, in
the words of the judicial oath, “to do right to all manner of
people, after the laws and usages of this realm.” Justice is
the end, law is merely the instrument and the means; and
the instrument must be defined by reference to its end.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is essential to a clear understanding of this matter to
remember that the administration of justice is perfectly possible
without law at all. Howsoever expedient it may be,
howsoever usual it may be, it is not necessary that the courts
of the state should, in maintaining right and redressing wrong,
act according to those fixed and predetermined principles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>which are called the law. A tribunal in which right is done
to all manner of people in such fashion as commends itself
to the unfettered discretion of the judge, in which equity and
good conscience and natural justice are excluded by no rigid
and artificial rules, in which the judge does that which he
deems just in the particular case, regardless of general
principles, may not be an efficient or trustworthy tribunal,
but is a perfectly possible one. It is a court of justice, which
is not also a court of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, even when a system of law exists, the extent
of it may vary indefinitely. The degree in which the free
discretion of a judge in doing right is excluded by predetermined
rules of law, is capable of indefinite increase or
diminution. The total exclusion of judicial discretion by
legal principle is impossible in any system. However great
is the encroachment of the law, there must remain some
residuum of justice which is not according to law—some
activities in respect of which the administration of justice
cannot be defined or regarded as the enforcement of the
law. Law is a gradual growth from small beginnings. The
development of a legal system consists in the progressive
substitution of rigid pre-established principles for individual
judgment, and to a very large extent these principles grow
up spontaneously within the tribunals themselves. That
great aggregate of rules which constitutes a developed legal
system is not a condition precedent of the administration
of justice, but a product of it. Gradually from various
sources—precedent, custom, statute—there is collected a
body of fixed principles which the courts apply to the exclusion
of their private judgment. The question at issue in
the administration of justice more and more ceases to be,
“What is the right and justice of this case?” and more and
more assumes the alternative form, “What is the general
principle already established and accepted, as applicable to
such a case as this?” Justice becomes increasingly justice
according to law, and courts of justice become increasingly
courts of law.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ 8. <b>Law and Fact.</b></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The existence of law is, as has been said, marked and
measured by the exclusion, in courts of justice, of individual
judgment by authority, of free discretion by rule, of liberty of
opinion by pre-established determinations. The remarkable
extent to which this exclusion is permitted is a very characteristic
feature of the administration of justice; but it is not
and cannot be complete. Judicial action is accordingly
divisible into two provinces; one being that of law, and the
other that of fact. All matters that come for consideration
before courts of justice are either matters of law or matters of
fact. The former are those falling within the sphere of pre-established
and authoritative principle, while the latter are
those pertaining to the province of unfettered judicial discretion.
In other words, every question which requires an
answer in a court of justice is either one of law or one of fact.
The former is one to be answered in accordance with established
principles—one which has been already authoritatively
answered, explicitly or implicitly, by the law. A question of
fact, on the other hand, is one which has not been thus predetermined—one
on which authority is silent—one which the
court may and must answer and determine in accordance
with its own individual judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be clearly understood that by a question of fact,
as we have used the expression, is meant any question whatever
except one of law, whether that question is, or is not, one
of fact in the other senses of this equivocal term. We are
not concerned, for example, with the distinction between
matters of fact and matters of <em>right</em>, or with that between
matters of fact and matters of <em>opinion</em>. Everything is fact
for us which is not predetermined by legal principles. It is
clear that this is the sense in which this term must inevitably
be used, if the distinction between questions of fact and
questions of law is to be exhaustive and logical.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distinction may be illustrated by the following
examples:—</p>

<p class='c019'>Whether a contractor has been guilty of unreasonable delay in building
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>a house is a question of fact; the law contains no rules for its determination.
But whether the holder of a bill of exchange has been guilty of unreasonable
delay in giving notice of dishonour, is a question of law to be
determined in accordance with certain fixed principles laid down in the
Bills of Exchange Act.</p>

<p class='c019'>Whether verbal or written evidence of a contract is the better, is a
question of law, the superiority of the latter being the subject of a pre-existing
and authoritative generalisation. But whether the oral testimony
of A. or that of B. is the better evidence, is a question of fact, left entirely
to the untrammelled judgment of the court.</p>

<p class='c019'>What is the proper and reasonable punishment for murder is a question
of law, individual judicial opinion being absolutely excluded by a fixed
rule. What is the proper and reasonable punishment for theft is (save so
far as judicial discretion is limited by the statutory appointment of a
maximum limit) a question of fact, on which the law has nothing to
say.</p>

<p class='c019'>The question whether a child accused of crime has sufficient mental
capacity to be criminally responsible for his acts, is one of fact, if the
accused is over the age of seven years, but one of law (to be answered in
the negative) if he is under that age.</p>

<p class='c019'>The point in issue is the meaning of a particular clause in an Act of
Parliament. Whether this is a question of fact or of law, depends on
whether the clause has already been the subject of authoritative judicial
interpretation. If not, it is one of fact for the opinion of the court. If,
however, there has already been a decision on the point, the question is
one of law to be decided in accordance with the previous determination.
The conclusion may seem paradoxical that a question of statutory interpretation
may be one of fact, but a little consideration will show that
the statement is correct. It is true, indeed, that the question is one as
to what the law is, but a question of law does not mean one as to what
the law is, but one to be determined in accordance with a rule of
law.</p>

<p class='c007'>A question is very often both one of fact and one of law, and
is then said to be a mixed question of law and of fact. It is to
be answered partly in accordance with fixed legal principles,
and as to the residue in accordance with free judicial opinion.
That is to say, it is not a simple, but a composite question,
resolvable into a greater or less number of simple factors, some
of which pertain to the sphere of the law and the others to
that of fact. Let us take, for example, the question as to the
proper term of imprisonment for a certain convicted criminal.
This may, according to circumstances, be a pure question of
fact, a pure question of law, or a mixed question of law and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>of fact. It belongs to the first of these classes, if the law contains
no provision whatever on the matter, the court having
in consequence a perfectly free hand. It belongs to the
second class, if the matter is definitely predetermined by a
fixed rule, appointing the exact length of imprisonment to be
awarded. It belongs to the third class, if the law has fixed a
minimum or maximum term, but has left the court with full
liberty within the appointed limits. Similarly, whether the
defendant has been guilty of fraud is a mixed question of law
and of fact, because it is resolvable into two elements, one of
law and the other of fact; what acts the defendant has done,
and with what intent he did them, are pure questions of fact;
but whether such acts, done with such an intent, amount to
fraud is a pure question of law. So the question whether a
partnership exists between A. and B. is partly one of fact
(viz., what agreement has been made between these persons),
and partly one of law (viz., whether such an agreement
constitutes the relation of partnership). Similar composite
questions are innumerable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distinction between matters of fact and matters of law
is thrown into great prominence by the composite character
of the typical English tribunal and the resulting division of
functions between judge and jury. The general rule is that
questions of law are for the judge and questions of fact for
the jury. This rule is subject, however, to numerous and
important exceptions. Though there are no cases in which
the law is left to the jury, there are many questions of fact
which are withdrawn from the cognisance of the jury and
answered by the judge. The interpretation of a written
document, for example, may be, and very often is, a pure
matter of fact, and nevertheless falls within the province of
the judge. So the question of reasonable and probable cause
for prosecution—which arises in actions for malicious prosecution—is
one of fact and yet one for the judge himself. So
it is the duty of the judge to decide whether there is any
sufficient evidence to justify a verdict for the plaintiff, and if
he decides that there is not, the case is withdrawn from the
jury altogether; yet in the majority of cases this is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>mere matter of fact, undetermined by any authoritative
principles.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The validity of a legal principle is entirely independent of
its truth. It is a valid principle of law, not because it is true,
but because it is accepted and acted on by the tribunals of the
state. The law is the theory of things, as received and acted
on within the courts of justice, and this theory may or may
not conform to the reality of things outside. The eye of the
law does not infallibly see things as they are. Nor is this
divergence of law from truth and fact necessarily, and in its
full extent, inexpedient. The law, if it is to be an efficient
and workable system, must needs be blind to many things,
and the legal theory of things must be simpler than the
reality. Partly by deliberate design, therefore, and partly by
the errors and accidents of historical development, law and
fact, legal theory and the truth of things, are far from complete
coincidence. We have ever to distinguish that which
exists in deed and in truth, from that which exists in law.
Fraud in law, for example, may not be fraud in fact, and
<i><span lang="la">vice versa</span></i>. That is to say, when the law lays down a principle
determining, in any class of cases, what shall be deemed
fraud, and what shall not, this principle may or may not be
true, and so far as it is untrue, the truth of things is excluded
by the legal theory of things. In like manner, that which
is considered right or reasonable by the law may be far from
possessing these qualities in truth and fact. Legal justice
may conflict with natural justice; a legal wrong may not be
also a moral wrong, nor a legal duty a moral duty.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ 9. <b>The Justification of the Law.</b></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>We have seen that the existence of law is not essential to
the administration of justice. Howsoever expedient, it is not
necessary that this function of the state should be exercised
in accordance with those rigid principles which constitute a
legal system. The primary purpose of the judicature is not
to enforce law, but to maintain justice, and this latter purpose
is in its nature separable from the former and independent
of it. Even when justice is administered according
to law, the proportion between the sphere of legal principle
and that of judicial discretion is different in different systems,
and varies from time to time. This being so, it is well to
make inquiry into the uses and justification of the law—to
consider the advantages and disadvantages of this substitution
of fixed principles for the <i><span lang="la">arbitrium judicis</span></i> in the administration
of justice—in order that we may be enabled to
judge whether this substitution be good or evil, and if good
within what limits it should be confined.</p>

<p class='c007'>That it is on the whole expedient that courts of justice
should become courts of law, no one can seriously doubt.
Yet the elements of evil involved in the transformation are
too obvious and serious ever to have escaped recognition.
Laws are in theory, as Hooker says, “the voices of right
reason”; they are in theory the utterances of Justice speaking
to men by the mouth of the state; but too often in
reality they fall far short of this ideal. Too often they
“turn judgment to wormwood,” and make the administration
of justice a reproach. Nor is this true merely of the
earlier and ruder stages of legal development. At the present
day our law has learnt, in a measure never before attained, to
speak the language of sound reason and good sense; but it
still retains in no slight degree the vices of its youth, nor is
it to be expected that at any time we shall altogether escape
from the perennial conflict between law and justice. It is
needful, therefore, that the law should plead and prove the
ground and justification of its existence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The chief uses of the law are three in number. The first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of these is that it imparts uniformity and certainty to the
administration of justice. It is vitally important not only
that judicial decisions should be correct, distinguishing
accurately between right and wrong, and appointing fitting
remedies for injustice, but also that the subjects of the state
should be able to know beforehand the decision to which on
any matter the courts of justice will come. This prevision is
impossible unless the course of justice is uniform, and the only
effectual method of procuring uniformity is the observance
of those fixed principles which constitute the law. It would
be well, were it possible, for the tribunals of the state to recognise
and enforce the rules of absolute justice; but it is better
to have defective rules than to have none at all. For we
expect from the coercive action of the state not merely the
maintenance of abstract justice, but the establishment within
the body politic of some measure of system, order, and
harmony, in the actions and relations of its members. It is
often more important that a rule should be definite, certain,
known, and permanent, than that it should be ideally just.
Sometimes, indeed, the element of order and certainty is the
only one which requires consideration, it being entirely indifferent
what the rule is, so long as it exists and is adhered
to. The rule of the road is the best and most familiar
example of this, but there are many other instances in which
justice seems dumb, and yet it is needful that a definite rule
of some sort should be adopted and maintained.</p>

<p class='c007'>For this reason we require in great part to exclude judicial
discretion by a body of inflexible law. For this reason it is,
that in no civilised community do the judges and magistrates
to whom is entrusted the duty of maintaining justice, exercise
with a free hand the <i><span lang="la">viri boni arbitrium</span></i>. The more
complex our civilisation becomes, the more needful is its
regulation by law, and the less practicable the alternative
method of judicial procedure. In simple and primitive
communities it is doubtless possible, and may even be expedient,
that rulers and magistrates should execute judgment
in such manner as best commends itself to them. But
in the civilisation to which we have now attained, any such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>attempt to substitute the deliverances of natural reason for
predetermined principles of law would lead to chaos.
“Reason,” says Jeremy Taylor,<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a> “is such a box of quicksilver
that it abides no where; it dwells in no settled mansion;
it is like a dove’s neck;&#160;... and if we inquire after the
law of nature” (that is to say, the principles of justice) “by
the rules of our reason, we shall be as uncertain as the discourses
of the people or the dreams of disturbed fancies.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It is to be observed in the second place that the necessity
of conforming to publicly declared principles protects the
administration of justice from the disturbing influence of
improper motives on the part of those entrusted with judicial
functions. The law is necessarily impartial. It is made
for no particular person, and for no individual case, and so
admits of no respect of persons, and is deflected from the
straight course by no irrelevant considerations peculiar to
the special instance. Given a definite rule of law, a departure
from it by a hair’s-breadth is visible to all men; but
within the sphere of individual judgment the differences of
honest opinion are so manifold and serious that dishonest
opinion can pass in great part unchallenged and undetected.
Where the duty of the judicature is to execute justice in
accordance with fixed and known principles, the whole force
of the public conscience can be brought to the enforcement
of that duty and the maintenance of those principles. But
when courts of justice are left to do that which is right
in their own eyes, this control becomes to a great extent
impossible, public opinion being left without that definite
guidance which is essential to its force and influence. So
much is this so, that the administration of justice according
to law is rightly to be regarded as one of the first principles
of political liberty. “The legislative or supreme
authority,” says Locke,<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a> “cannot assume to itself a power
to rule by extemporary, arbitrary decrees, but is bound
to dispense justice, and to decide the rights of the subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>by promulgated, standing laws, and known, authorized
judges.” So in the words of Cicero,<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a> “We are the slaves of
the law that we may be free.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to its impartiality far more than to its wisdom (for
this latter virtue it too often lacks) that are due the influence
and reputation which the law has possessed at all times.
Wise or foolish, it is the same for all, and to it, therefore,
men have ever been willing to submit their quarrels, knowing,
as Hooker<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c016'><sup>[15]</sup></a> says, that “the law doth speak with all indifferency;
that the law hath no side-respect to their persons.”
Hence the authority of a judgment according to law.
The reference of international disputes to arbitration, and the
loyal submission of nations to awards so made, are possible
only in proportion to the development and recognition of a
definite body of international law. The authority of the
<em>arbitrators</em> is naught; that of the <em>law</em> is already sufficient to
maintain in great part the peace of the world. So in the case
of the civil law, only so far as justice is transformed into law,
and the love of justice into the spirit of law-abidingness, will
the influence of the judicature rise to an efficient level, and
the purposes of civil government be adequately fulfilled.</p>

<p class='c006'>Finally, the law serves to protect the administration of
justice from the errors of individual judgment. The establishment
of the law is the substitution of the opinion and
conscience of the community at large for those of the individuals
to whom judicial functions are entrusted. The principles
of justice are not always clearly legible by the light
of nature. The problems offered for judicial solution are
often dark and difficult, and there is great need of guidance
from that experience and wisdom of the world at large, of
which the law is the record. The law is not always wise,
but on the whole and in the long run it is wiser than those
who administer it. It expresses the will and reason of the
body politic, and claims by that title to overrule the will
and reason of judges and magistrates, no less than those of
private men. “To seek to be wiser than the laws,” says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Aristotle,<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c016'><sup>[16]</sup></a> “is the very thing which is by good laws forbidden.”</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 10. <b>The Defects of the Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>These then are the chief advantages to be derived from
the exclusion of individual judgment by fixed principles of
law. Nevertheless these benefits are not obtained save at a
heavy cost. The law is without doubt a remedy for greater
evils, yet it brings with it evils of its own. Some of them
are inherent in its very nature, others are the outcome of
tendencies which, however natural, are not beyond the reach
of effective control.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first defect of a legal system is its rigidity. A general
principle of law is the product of a process of abstraction.
It results from the elimination and disregard of the less
material circumstances in the particular cases falling within
its scope, and the concentration of attention upon the more
essential elements which these cases have in common. We
cannot be sure that in applying a rule so obtained, the
elements so disregarded may not be material in the particular
instance; and if they are so, and we make no allowance
for them, the result is error and injustice. This possibility
is fully recognised in departments of practice other than
the law. The principles of political economy are obtained
by the elimination of every motive save the desire for wealth;
but we do not apply them blindfold to individual cases, without
first taking account of the possibly disturbing influence
of the eliminated elements. In law it is otherwise, for here a
principle is not a mere guide to the due exercise of a rational
discretion, but a substitute for it. It is to be applied without
any allowance for special circumstances, and without turning
to the right hand or to the left. The result of this inflexibility
is that, however carefully and cunningly a legal rule
may be framed, there will in all probability be some special
instances in which it will work hardship and injustice, and
prove a source of error instead of a guide to truth. So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>infinitely various are the affairs of men, that it is impossible
to lay down general principles which will be true and just in
every case. If we are to have general rules at all, we must
be content to pay this price.</p>

<p class='c007'>The time-honoured maxim, <i><span lang="la">Summum jus est summa injuria</span></i>,
is an expression of the fact that few legal principles are so
founded in truth that they can be pushed to their extremest
logical conclusions without leading to injustice. The more
general the principle, the greater is that elimination of immaterial
elements of which it is the result, and the greater
therefore is the chance that in its rigid application it may be
found false. On the other hand, the more carefully the rule
is qualified and limited, and the greater the number of exceptions
and distinctions to which it is subject, the greater is the
difficulty and uncertainty of its application. In attempting
to escape from the evils which flow from the rigidity of the
law, we incur those due to its complexity, and we do wisely
if we discover the golden mean between the two extremes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Analogous to the vice of rigidity is that of conservatism.
The former is the failure of the law to conform itself to the
requirements of special instances and unforeseen classes of
cases. The latter is its failure to conform itself to those
changes in circumstances and in men’s views of truth and
justice, which are inevitably brought about by the lapse of
time. In the absence of law, the administration of justice
would automatically adapt itself to the circumstances and
opinions of the time; but fettered by rules of law, courts of
justice do the bidding, not of the present, but of the times
past in which those rules were fashioned. That which is
true to-day may become false to-morrow by change of circumstances,
and that which is taken to-day for wisdom may
to-morrow be recognised as folly by the advance of knowledge.
This being so, some method is requisite whereby the
law, which is by nature stationary, may be kept in harmony
with the circumstances and opinions of the time. If the
law is to be a living organism, and not a mere petrification, it
is necessary to adopt and to use with vigilance some effective
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>instrument of legal development, and the quality of any legal
system will depend on the efficiency of the means so taken
to secure it against a fatal conservatism. Legislation—the
substitution of new principles for old by the express declaration
of the state—is the instrument approved by all civilised
and progressive races, none other having been found comparable
to this in point of efficiency. Even this, however, is
incapable of completely counteracting the evil of legal conservatism.
However perfect we may make our legislative
machinery, the law will lag behind public opinion, and public
opinion behind the truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another vice of the law is formalism. By this is meant
the tendency to attribute undue importance to form as
opposed to substance, and to exalt the immaterial to the
level of the material. It is incumbent on a perfect legal
system to exercise a sound judgment as to the relative
importance of the matters which come within its cognisance;
and a system is infected with formalism in so far as it fails
to meet this requirement, and raises to the rank of the
material and essential that which is in truth unessential and
accidental. Whenever the importance of a thing in law is
greater than its importance in fact, we have a legal formality.
The formalism of ancient law is too notorious to require
illustration, but we are scarcely yet in a position to boast
ourselves as above reproach in this matter. Much legal
reform is requisite if the maxim <i><span lang="la">De minimis non curat lex</span></i> is
to be accounted anything but irony.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last defect that we shall consider is undue and needless
complexity. It is not possible, indeed, for any fully
developed body of law to be such that he who runs may read
it. Being, as it is, the reflection within courts of justice of
the complex facts of civilised existence, a very considerable
degree of elaboration is inevitable. Nevertheless the gigantic
bulk and bewildering difficulties of our own labyrinthine
system are far beyond anything that is called for by the
necessities of the case. Partly through the methods of its
historical development, and partly through the influence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>that love of subtilty which has always been the besetting sin
of the legal mind, our law is filled with needless distinctions,
which add enormously to its bulk and nothing to its value,
while they render great part of it unintelligible to any but
the expert. This tendency to excessive subtilty and elaboration
is one that specially affects a system which, like our
own, has been largely developed by way of judicial decisions.
It is not, however, an unavoidable defect, and the codes which
have in modern times been enacted in European countries
prove the possibility of reducing the law to a system of
moderate size and intelligible simplicity.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the foregoing considerations as to the advantages
and disadvantages which are inherent in the administration
of justice according to law, it becomes clear that we must
guard against the excessive development of the legal system.
If the benefits of law are great, the evils of too much law are
not small. The growth of a legal system consists in the
progressive encroachment of the sphere of law upon that of
fact, the gradual exclusion of judicial discretion by predetermined
legal principles. All systems do to some extent,
and those which recognise precedent as a chief source of law
do more especially, show a tendency to carry this process of
development too far. Under the influence of the spirit of
authority the growth of law goes on unchecked by any
effective control, and in course of time the domain of legal
principle comes to include much that would be better left to
the <i><span lang="la">arbitrium</span></i> of courts of justice. At a certain stage of legal
development, varying according to the particular subject-matter,
the benefits of law begin to be outweighed by those
elements of evil which are inherent in it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bacon has said, after Aristotle:<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c016'><sup>[17]</sup></a> <i><span lang="la">Optima est lex quae
minimum relinquit arbitrio judicis</span></i>. However true this may
be in general, there are many departments of judicial practice
to which no such principle is applicable. Much has been
done in recent times to prune the law of morbid growths.
In many departments judicial discretion has been freed from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the bonds of legal principle. Forms of action have been
abolished; rules of pleading have been relaxed; the credibility
of witnesses has become a matter of fact, instead of as
formerly one of law; a discretionary power of punishment
has been substituted for the terrible legal uniformity which
once disgraced the administration of criminal justice; and
the future will see further reforms in the same direction.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have hitherto taken it for granted that legal principles
are necessarily inflexible—that they are essentially peremptory
rules excluding judicial discretion so far as they extend—that
they must of necessity be followed blindly by courts of
justice even against their better judgment. There seems no
reason, however, in the nature of things why the law should
not, to a considerable extent, be flexible instead of rigid—should
not aid, guide, and inform judicial discretion, instead
of excluding it—should not be subject to such exceptions and
qualifications as in special circumstances the courts of justice
shall deem reasonable or requisite. There is no apparent
reason why the law should say to the judicature: “Do this
in all cases, whether you consider it reasonable or not,” instead
of: “Do this except in those cases in which you consider
that there are special reasons for doing otherwise.”
Such flexible principles are not unknown even at the present
day, and it seems probable that in the more perfect system
of the future much law that is now rigid and peremptory will
lapse into the category of the conditional. It will always,
indeed, be found needful to maintain great part of it on the
higher level, but we have not yet realised to what an extent
flexible principles are sufficient to attain all the good purposes
of the law, while avoiding much of its attendant evil. It is
probable, for instance, that the great bulk of the law of
evidence should be of this nature. These rules should for
the most part guide judicial discretion, instead of excluding
it. In the former capacity, being in general founded on
experience and good sense, they would be valuable aids to the
discovery of truth; in the latter, they are too often the
instruments of error.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ 11. <b>General and Special Law.</b></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The whole body of legal rules is divisible into two parts,
which may be conveniently distinguished as General law and
Special law. The former includes those legal rules of which
the courts will take judicial notice, and which will therefore
be applied as a matter of course in any case in which the
appropriate subject-matter is present. Special law, on the
other hand, consists of those rules which, although they are
true rules of law, the courts will not recognise and apply as
a matter of course, but which must be specially proved and
brought to the notice of the courts by the parties interested
in their recognition. In other words, the general law is that
which is generally applicable; it is that which will be applied
in all cases in which it is not specially excluded by proof that
some other set of principles has a better claim to recognition
in the particular instance. Special law, on the contrary, is
that which has only a special or particular application, excluding
and superseding the general law in those exceptional
cases in which the courts are informed of its existence by
evidence produced for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>The test of the distinction is judicial notice. By this is
meant the knowledge which any court, <em>ex officio</em>, possesses
and acts on, as contrasted with the knowledge which a court
is bound to acquire through the appointed channel of evidence
formally produced by the parties. A judge may know much
in fact of which in law he is deemed ignorant, and of which,
therefore, he must be informed by evidence legally produced.
Conversely he may be ignorant in fact of much that by law
he is entitled judicially to notice, and in such a case it is his
right and duty to inform himself by such means as seem
good to him. The general rule on the matter is that courts
of justice know the law, but are ignorant of the facts. The
former may and must be judicially noticed, while the latter
must be proved. To each branch of this rule there are,
however, important exceptions. There are certain exceptional
classes of facts, of which, because of their notoriety,
the law imputes a knowledge to the courts. Similarly there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>are certain classes of legal rules of which the courts may,
and indeed must, hold themselves ignorant, until due proof
of their existence has been produced before them. These, as
we have said, constitute special, as opposed to the general law.</p>

<p class='c007'>By far the larger and more important part of the legal
system is general law. Judicial notice—recognition and
application as a matter of course—is the ordinary rule. As
to this branch of the law we need say nothing more in this
place, but the rules of special law call for further consideration.
They fall for the most part into five distinct classes.
A full account of these must wait until we come to deal with
the sources of law in a subsequent chapter, but in the meantime
it is necessary to mention them as illustrating the
distinction with which we are here concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>Local customs.</em>—Immemorial custom in a particular
locality has there the force of law. Within its own territorial
limits it prevails over, and derogates from, the general law
of the land. But the courts are judicially ignorant of its
existence. If any litigant will take advantage of it, he must
specially plead and prove it; otherwise the general law will
be applied.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>Mercantile customs.</em>—The second kind of special law
consists of that body of mercantile usage which is known as
the law merchant. The general custom of merchants in the
realm of England has in mercantile affairs the force of law.
It may make, for example, an instrument negotiable, which by
the general law of the land is not so. This customary law
merchant is, like local customary law, special and not general;
but, unlike local customary law, it has the capacity of being
absorbed by, or taken up into the general law itself. When a
mercantile usage has been sufficiently established by evidence
and acknowledged as law by judicial decision, it is thereafter
entitled to judicial notice. The process of proof need not be
repeated from time to time.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c016'><sup>[18]</sup></a> The result of this doctrine is a
progressive transformation of the rules of the special law
merchant into rules of the general law. The law of bills of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>exchange, for example, was formerly part of the special law
merchant, requiring to be pleaded and proved as a condition
precedent to its recognition and application; but successive
judicial decisions, based upon evidence of this special law,
have progressively transmuted it into general law, entitled to
judicial notice and to application as a matter of course.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>Private legislation.</em>—Statutes are of two kinds, distinguishable
as public and private. The distinguishing characteristic
of a public Act is that judicial notice is taken of its
existence, and it is therefore one of the sources of the general
law. A private Act, on the other hand, is one which, owing
to its limited scope, does not fall within the ordinary cognisance
of the courts of justice, and will not be applied by
them unless specially called to their notice by the parties
interested. Examples of private legislation are acts incorporating
individual companies and laying down the principles
on which they are to be administered, acts regulating the
navigation of some river, or the construction and management
of some harbour, or any other enactments concerned,
not with the interests of the realm or the public at large,
but with those of private individuals or particular localities.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c016'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Private legislation is not limited to acts of Parliament. In
most cases, though not in all, the delegated legislation of
bodies subordinate to Parliament is private, and is therefore
a source, not of general, but of special law. The by-laws of a
railway company, for example, or of a borough council, are not
entitled to judicial notice, and form no part of the general law
of the land. Rules of court, on the other hand, established
by the judges under statutory authority for the regulation
of the procedure of the courts, are constituent parts of the
ordinary law.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>Foreign law.</em>—The fourth kind of special law consists of
those rules of foreign law, which upon occasion are applied
even in English courts to the exclusion of English law.
Experience has shown that justice cannot be efficiently
administered by tribunals which refuse on all occasions to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>recognise any law but their own. It is essential in many
cases to take account of some system of foreign law, and to
measure the rights and liabilities of litigants by it, rather
than by the indigenous or territorial law of the tribunal
itself. If, for example, two men make a contract in France,
which they intend to be governed by the law of France, and
one of them sues on it in an English court, justice demands
that the validity and effect of the contract shall be determined
by French, rather than by English law. French,
rather than English law will therefore be applied in such a
case even by English judges. The principles which determine
and regulate this exclusion of local by foreign law
constitute the body of legal doctrine known as private
international law.</p>

<p class='c007'>Foreign law, so far as it is thus recognised in English
courts, becomes, by virtue of this recognition, in a certain
sense English law. French law is French as being applied
in France, but English as being applied in England. Yet
though it is then part of English law, as being administered in
English courts, it is not part of the general law, for English
courts have no official knowledge of any law save their own.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. <em>Conventional law.</em>—The fifth and last form of special law
is that which has its source in the agreement of those who
are subject to it. Agreement is a juridical fact having two
aspects, and capable of being looked at from two points of
view. It is both a source of legal rights and a source of
law. The former of these two aspects is the more familiar
and in ordinary cases the more convenient, but in numerous
instances the latter is profitable and instructive. The rules
laid down in a contract, for the determination of the rights,
duties, and liabilities of the parties, may rightly be regarded
as rules of law which these parties have agreed to substitute
for, or add to the rules of the general law. Agreement is a
law for those who make it, which supersedes, supplements,
or derogates from the ordinary law of the land. <i><span lang="la">Modus et
conventio vincunt legem.</span></i> To a very large extent, though not
completely, the general law is not peremptory and absolute,
but consists of rules whose force is conditional on the absence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>of any other rules agreed upon by the parties interested.
The articles of association of a company, for example, are just
as much true rules of law, as are the provisions of the Companies
Acts, or those statutory regulations which apply in the
absence of any articles specially agreed upon. So articles of
partnership fall within the definition of law, no less than the
provisions of the Partnership Act which they are intended to
supplement or modify, for both sets of rules are authoritative
principles which the courts will apply in all litigation affecting
the affairs of the partnership.</p>

<p class='c019'>We have made the distinction between general and special law turn
wholly upon the fact that judicial notice is taken of the former but not
of the latter. It may be objected that this is a merely external and
superficial view of the matter. General law, it may be argued, is so
called because it is common to the whole realm and to all persons in it,
while special law is that which has a special and limited application to
particular places or classes of persons. In this contention there is an
element of truth, but it falls short of a logical analysis of the distinction
in question. It is true that the general law is usually wider in its application
than special law. It is chiefly for this reason, indeed, that the former
is, while the latter is not, deemed worthy of judicial notice. But we have
here no logical basis for a division of the legal system into two parts.
Much of the general law itself applies to particular classes of persons only.
The law of solicitors, of auctioneers, or of pawnbrokers, is of very restricted
application; yet it is just as truly part of the ordinary law of the
land as is the law of theft, homicide, or libel, which applies to all mankind.
The law of the royal prerogative is not special law, by reason of the fact
that it applies only to a single individual; it is a constituent part of the
general law. On the other hand, mercantile usage is dependent for its
legal validity on its generality; it must be the custom of the realm, not that
of any particular part of it; yet until, by judicial proof and recognition, it
becomes entitled for the future to judicial notice, it is the special law
merchant, standing outside the ordinary law of the land. The law of bills
of exchange is no more general in its application now, than it ever was; yet
it has now ceased to be special, and has become incorporated into the
general law. The element of truth involved in the argument now under
consideration is no more than this, that the comparative generality of
their application is one of the most important matters to be taken into
consideration in determining whether judicial notice shall or shall not be
granted to rules of law.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 12. <b>Common Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The term common law is used by English lawyers with unfortunate
diversities of meaning. It is one of the contrasted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>terms in at least three different divisions of the legal
system:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>Common law and statute law.</em>—By the common law is
sometimes meant the whole of the law except that which has
its origin in statutes or some other form of legislation. It is
the unenacted law that is produced by custom or precedent,
as opposed to the enacted law made by Parliament or subordinate
legislative authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>Common law and equity.</em>—In another sense common law
means the whole of the law (enacted or unenacted) except
that portion which was developed and administered exclusively
by the old Court of Chancery, and which is distinguished
as equity.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a> It is in this sense, for example, that
we speak of the Court of King’s Bench or Exchequer as being
a court of common law.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>Common law and special law.</em>—In yet a third sense
common law is a synonym of what we have already called
general law, the ordinary law of the land, as opposed to the
various forms of special law, such as local customs, which will
not be applied as a matter of course in the administration of
justice, but only when specially pleaded and proved.</p>

<p class='c019'>The expression common law (<i><span lang="la">jus commune</span></i>) was adopted by English
lawyers from the canonists, who used it to denote the general law of
the Church as opposed to those divergent usages (<i><span lang="la">consuetudines</span></i>) which
prevailed in different local jurisdictions, and superseded or modified
within their own territorial limits the common law of Christendom.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c016'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
This canonical usage must have been familiar to the ecclesiastical judges
of the English law courts of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and was
adopted by them. We find the distinction between common law and
special law (<i><span lang="la">commune ley</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">especial ley</span></i>) well established in the earliest
Year Books.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c016'><sup>[22]</sup></a> The common law is the ordinary system administered by
the ordinary royal courts, and is contrasted with two other forms of law.
It is opposed, in the first place, to that which is not administered in the
ordinary royal courts at all, but by special tribunals governed by different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>systems. Thus we have the common law in the Court of King’s Bench,
but the canon law in the Ecclesiastical Courts, the civil law in the Court of
Admiralty, and, at a later date, the law which was called equity in the
Court of Chancery.</p>

<p class='c019'>In the second place the common law was contrasted with those various
forms of special law which were recognised even in the King’s ordinary
courts in derogation of the general law of the land. Thus it is opposed
to local custom (<i><span lang="la">la commune ley</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">le usage del pays</span></i>);<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a> to the law merchant
(<i><span lang="la">la commune ley</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">la ley merchaunde</span></i>);<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c016'><sup>[24]</sup></a> to statute law;<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c016'><sup>[25]</sup></a> and
to conventional law (<i><span lang="la">specialis conventio contra jus commune</span></i>).<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c016'><sup>[26]</sup></a> The opposition
of common and statute law is noteworthy. Statute law is conceived
originally as special law, derogating from the ordinary law of the King’s
courts. It was <i><span lang="la">contra jus commune</span></i>, just as contracts and local customs
and the law merchant were <i><span lang="la">contra jus commune</span></i>. Such a point of view,
indeed, is not logically defensible. A public and general statute does not
bear the same relation to the rest of the law as a local or mercantile custom
bears to it. Logically or not, however, statutes were classed side by side
with the various forms of special law which derogated from the <i><span lang="la">jus commune</span></i>.
Hence the modern usage by which the common law in one of its
senses means unwritten or unenacted law, as opposed to all law which
has its origin in legislation.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 13. <b>Law and Equity.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Until the year 1873 England presented the extremely
curious spectacle of two distinct and rival systems of law,
administered at the same time by different tribunals. These
systems were distinguished as common law and equity, or
merely as law and equity (using the term law in a narrow
sense as including one only of the two systems). The common
law was the older, being coeval with the rise of royal
justice in England, and it was administered in the older
Courts, namely the King’s Bench, the Court of Common Pleas,
and the Exchequer. Equity was the more modern body of
legal doctrine, developed and administered by the Chancellor
in the Court of Chancery as supplementary to, and corrective
of, the older law. To a large extent the two systems were
identical and harmonious, for it was a maxim of the Chancery
that equity follows the law (<i><span lang="la">Aequitas sequitur legem</span></i>); that is
to say, the rules already established in the older courts were
adopted by the Chancellors and incorporated into the system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>of equity, unless there was some sufficient reason for their
rejection or modification. In no small measure, however, law
and equity were discordant, applying different rules to the
same subject-matter. The same case would be decided in
one way, if brought before the Court of King’s Bench, and
in another, if adjudged in Chancery. The Judicature Act,
1873, put an end to this anomalous state of things, by the
abolition of all portions of the common law which conflicted
with equity, and by the consequent fusion of the two systems
into a single and self-consistent body of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distinction between law and equity has thus become
historical merely, but it has not for that reason ceased to
demand attention. It is not only a matter of considerable
theoretical interest, but it has so left its mark upon our legal
system, that its comprehension is still essential even in the
practical study of the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The term equity possesses at least three distinct though
related senses. In the first of these, it is nothing more than a
synonym for natural justice. <i><span lang="la">Aequitas</span></i> is <i><span lang="la">aequalitas</span></i>—the fair
impartial, or equal allotment of good and evil—the virtue
which gives to every man his own. This is the popular
application of the term, and possesses no special juridical
significance.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. In a second and legal sense equity means natural justice,
not simply, but in a special aspect; that is to say, as opposed
to the rigour of inflexible rules of law. <i><span lang="la">Aequitas</span></i> is contrasted
with <i><span lang="la">summum jus</span></i>, or <i><span lang="la">strictum jus</span></i>, or the <i><span lang="la">rigor juris</span></i>. For the
law lays down general principles, taking of necessity no
account of the special circumstances of individual cases in
which such generality may work injustice. So also, the law
may with defective foresight have omitted to provide at all
for the case in hand, and therefore supplies no remedy for the
aggrieved suitor. In all such cases in order to avoid injustice,
it is needful to go beyond the law, or even contrary to
the law, and to administer justice in accordance with the
dictates of natural reason. This it is that is meant by administering
equity as opposed to law; and so far as any
tribunal possesses the power of thus supplementing or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>rejecting the rules of law in special cases, it is, in this sense
of the term, a court of equity, as opposed to a court of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distinction thus indicated was received in the juridical
theory both of the Greeks and the Romans. Aristotle defines
equity as the correction of the law where it is defective on
account of its generality,<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c016'><sup>[27]</sup></a> and the definition is constantly
repeated by later writers. Elsewhere he says:<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c016'><sup>[28]</sup></a> “An arbitrator
decides in accordance with equity, a judge in accordance
with law: and it was for this purpose that arbitration
was introduced, namely, that equity might prevail.” In the
writings of Cicero we find frequent reference to the distinction
between <i><span lang="la">aequitas</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>. He quotes as already proverbial
the saying, <i><span lang="la">Summum jus summa injuria</span></i>,<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c016'><sup>[29]</sup></a> meaning by
<i><span lang="la">summum jus</span></i> the rigour of the law untempered by equity.
Numerous indications of the same conception are to be met
with in the writings of the Roman jurists.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c016'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The doctrine passed from Greek and Latin literature into
the traditional jurisprudence of the Middle Ages. We may
see, for example, a discussion of the matter in the <i><span lang="la">Tractatus
de Legibus</span></i> of Aquinas.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c016'><sup>[31]</sup></a> It was well known, therefore, to the
lawyers who laid the foundations of our own legal system, and
like other portions of scholastic doctrine, it passed into the
English law courts of the thirteenth century. There is good
reason for concluding that the King’s courts of that day did
not consider themselves so straitly bound by statute, custom,
or precedent, as to be incapable upon occasion of doing justice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>that went beyond the law.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c016'><sup>[32]</sup></a> It was not until later that the
common law so hardened into an inflexible and inexpansive
system of <i><span lang="la">strictum jus</span></i>, that <i><span lang="la">aequitas</span></i> fled from the older courts
to the newly established tribunal of the Chancellor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court of Chancery, an offshoot from the King’s
Council, was established to administer the equity which the
common law had rejected, and of which the common law
courts had declared themselves incapable. It provided an
appeal from the rigid, narrow, and technical rules of the
King’s courts of law, to the conscience and equity of the
King himself, speaking by the mouth of his Chancellor. The
King was the source and fountain of justice. The administration
of justice was part of the royal prerogative, and the
exercise of it had been delegated by the King to his servants,
the judges. These judges held themselves bound by the inflexible
rules established in their courts, but not so the King.
A subject might have recourse, therefore, to the natural
justice of the King, if distrustful of the legal justice of the
King’s courts. Here he could obtain <i><span lang="la">aequitas</span></i>, if the <i><span lang="la">strictum
jus</span></i> of the law courts was insufficient for his necessities. This
equitable jurisdiction of the Crown, after having been exercised
for a time by the King’s Council, was subsequently
delegated to the Chancellor, who, as exercising it, was deemed
to be the keeper of the royal conscience.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. We have now reached a position from which we can see
how the term equity acquired its third and last signification.
In this sense, which is peculiar to English nomenclature, it
is no longer opposed to law, but is itself a particular kind of
law. It is that body of law which is administered in the
Court of Chancery, as contrasted with the other and rival
system administered in the common law courts. Equity is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Chancery law as opposed to the common law. The equity
of the Chancery has changed its nature and meaning. It
was not originally law at all, but natural justice. The Chancellor,
in the first days of his equitable jurisdiction, did not
go about to set up and administer a new form of law, standing
side by side with that already recognised in the Court of
Common Pleas. His purpose was to administer justice without
law, and this purpose he in fact fulfilled for many a day.
In its origin the jurisdiction of the Chancellor was unfettered
by any rules whatever. His duty was to do that “which
justice, and reason, and good faith, and good conscience
require in the case.”<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c016'><sup>[33]</sup></a> And of such requirements he was in
each particular case to judge at his own good pleasure. In
due time, however, there commenced that process of the
encroachment of established principle upon judicial discretion,
which marks the growth of all legal systems. By
degrees the Chancellor suffered himself to be restricted by
rule and precedent in his interpretation and execution of the
dictates of the royal conscience. Just in so far as this change
proceeded, the system administered in Chancery ceased to be
a system of equity in the original sense, and became the same
in essence as the common law itself. The final result was
the establishment in England of a second system of law,
standing over against the older law, in many respects an improvement
on it, yet no less than it, a scheme of rigid, technical,
predetermined principles. And the law thus developed
was called equity, because it was in equity that it had its
source.</p>

<p class='c007'>Closely analogous to this equity-law of the English Chancellor
is the <i><span lang="la">jus praetorium</span></i> of the Roman praetor. The
praetor, the supreme judicial magistrate of the Roman
republic, had much the same power as the Chancellor of
supplying and correcting the deficiencies and errors of the
older law by recourse to <i><span lang="la">aequitas</span></i>. Just as the exercise of this
power gave rise in England to a body of Chancery law, standing
by the side of the common law, so in Rome a <i><span lang="la">jus praetorium</span></i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>grew up distinct from the older <i><span lang="la">jus civile</span></i>. “Jus
praetorium,” says Papinian,<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c016'><sup>[34]</sup></a> “est quod praetores introduxerunt,
adjuvandi vel supplendi vel corrigendi juris civilis
gratia, propter utilitatem publicam.” The chief distinction
between the Roman and the English cases is that at Rome
the two systems of law coexisted in the same court, the <i><span lang="la">jus
praetorium</span></i> practically superseding the <i><span lang="la">jus civile</span></i> so far as
inconsistent with it; whereas in England, as we have seen,
law and equity were administered by distinct tribunals.
Moreover, although the <i><span lang="la">jus praetorium</span></i> had its source in the
<i><span lang="la">aequitas</span></i> of the praetor, it does not seem that this body of law
was ever itself called <i><span lang="la">aequitas</span></i>. This transference of meaning
is peculiar to English usage.<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c016'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='c013'>OTHER KINDS OF LAW.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 14. <b>Law in General—A Rule of Action.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Having considered in the foregoing chapter the nature of
civil law exclusively, we now proceed to examine certain other
kinds of law which need to be distinguished from this and
from each other. In its widest and vaguest sense the term
law includes any rule of action: that is to say, any standard
or pattern to which actions (whether the acts of rational
agents or the operations of nature) are or ought to be conformed.
In the words of Hooker,<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c016'><sup>[36]</sup></a> “we term any kind of rule
or canon whereby actions are framed a law.” So Blackstone
says:<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c016'><sup>[37]</sup></a> “Law, in its most general and comprehensive sense,
signifies a rule of action, and is applied indiscriminately to all
kinds of action, whether animate or inanimate, rational or
irrational. Thus we say, the laws of motion, of gravitation,
of optics or mechanics, as well as the laws of nature and of
nations.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Of law in this sense there are many kinds, and the following
are sufficiently important and distinct to deserve separate
mention and examination: (1) Physical or Scientific law,
(2) Natural or Moral law, (3) Imperative law, (4) Conventional
law, (5) Customary law, (6) Practical law, (7) International
law, (8) Civil law. Before proceeding to analyse
and distinguish these, there are the following introductory
observations to be made:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) This list is not based on any logical scheme of division
and classification, but is a mere <i><span lang="la">simplex enumeratio</span></i> of the
chief forms of law.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>(2) There is nothing to prevent the same rule from belonging
to more than one of these classes.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) Any discussion as to the rightful claims of any of these
classes of rules to be called law—any attempt to distinguish
law properly so called from law improperly so called—would
seem to be nothing more than a purposeless dispute
about words. Our business is to recognise the fact that they
<em>are</em> called law, and to distinguish accurately between the
different classes of rules that are thus known by the same
name.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 15. <b>Physical or Scientific Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Physical laws or the laws of science are expressions of
the uniformities of nature—general principles expressing the
regularity and harmony observable in the activities and
operations of the universe. It is in this sense that we speak
of the law of gravitation, the laws of the tides, or the laws of
chemical combination. Even the actions of human beings,
so far as they are uniform, are the subject of law of this
description: as, for example, when we speak of the laws of
political economy, or of Grimm’s law of phonetics. These
are rules expressing not what men ought to do, but what
they do.</p>

<p class='c007'>Physical laws are also, and more commonly, called natural
laws, or the laws of nature; but these latter terms are
ambiguous, for they signify also the moral law; that is to
say the principles of natural right and wrong.</p>

<p class='c006'>This use of the term law to connote nothing more than
uniformity of action is derived from law in the sense of an
<em>imperative</em> rule of action, by way of the theological conception
of the universe as governed in all its operations (animate and
inanimate, rational and irrational) by the will and command
of God. The primary source of this conception is to be found
in the Hebrew scriptures, and its secondary and immediate
source in the scholasticism of the Middle Ages—a system of
thought which was formed by a combination of the theology
of the Hebrews with the philosophy of the Greeks. The
Bible constantly speaks of the Deity as governing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>universe, animate and inanimate, just as a ruler governs a
society of men; and the order of the world is conceived as
due to the obedience of all created things to the will and commands
of their Creator. “He gave to the sea his decree,
that the waters should not pass his commandment.”<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c016'><sup>[38]</sup></a> “He
made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the
thunder.”<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c016'><sup>[39]</sup></a> The schoolmen made this same conception one
of the first principles of their philosophic system. The <i><span lang="la">lex
aeterna</span></i>, according to St. Thomas Aquinas, is the ordinance of
the divine wisdom, by which all things in heaven and earth
are governed. “There is a certain eternal law, to wit, reason,
existing in the mind of God and governing the whole universe....
For law is nothing else than the dictate of the
practical reason in the ruler who governs a perfect community.”<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c016'><sup>[40]</sup></a>
“Just as the reason of the divine wisdom, inasmuch
as by it all things were created, has the nature of a type
or idea; so also, inasmuch as by this reason all things are
directed to their proper ends, it may be said to have the
nature of an eternal law.... And accordingly the law
eternal is nothing else than the reason of the divine wisdom
regarded as regulative and directive of all actions and
motions.”<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c016'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>This <i><span lang="la">lex aeterna</span></i> was divided by the schoolmen into two
parts. One of these is that which governs the actions of
men: this is the moral law, the law of nature, or of reason.
The other is that which governs the actions of all other
created things: this is that which we now term physical
law, or natural law in the modern and prevalent sense of
that ambiguous term.<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c016'><sup>[42]</sup></a> This latter branch of the eternal
law is perfectly and uniformly obeyed; for the irrational
agents on which it is imposed can do no otherwise than obey
the dictates of the divine will. But the former branch—the
moral law of reason—is obeyed only partially and imperfectly;
for man by reason of his prerogative of freedom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>may turn aside from that will to follow his own desires.
Physical law, therefore, is an expression of actions as they
actually are; moral law, or the law of reason, is an expression
of actions as they ought to be.</p>

<p class='c007'>This scholastic theory of law finds eloquent expression in
the writings of Hooker in the sixteenth century. “His
commanding those things to be which are, and to be in such
sort as they are, to keep that tenure and course which they
do, importeth the establishment of nature’s law.... Since
the time that God did first proclaim the edicts of his law
upon it, heaven and earth have hearkened unto his voice,
and their labour hath been to do his will.... See we not
plainly that the obedience of creatures unto the law of nature
is the stay of the whole world.”<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c016'><sup>[43]</sup></a> “Of law there can be no
less acknowledged, than that her seat is the bosom of God,
her voice the harmony of the world, all things in heaven and
earth do her homage.”<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c016'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The modern use of the term law, in the sense of physical
or natural law, to indicate the uniformities of nature, is
directly derived from this scholastic theory of the <i><span lang="la">lex aeterna</span></i>;
but the theological conception of divine legislation on which
it was originally based is now eliminated or disregarded.
The relation between the physical law of inanimate nature
and the moral or civil laws by which men are ruled has been
reduced accordingly to one of remote analogy.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 16. <b>Natural or Moral Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>By natural or moral law is meant the principles of natural
right and wrong—the principles of natural justice, if we use
the term justice in its widest sense to include all forms of
rightful action. Right or justice is of two kinds, distinguished
as natural and positive. Natural justice is justice as it is
in deed and in truth—in its perfect idea. Positive justice
is justice as it is conceived, recognised, and expressed, more
or less incompletely and inaccurately, by the civil or some
other form of human and positive law. Just as positive law,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>therefore, is the expression of positive justice, so philosophers
have recognised a natural law, which is the expression
of natural justice.</p>

<p class='c007'>This distinction between natural and positive justice,
together with the corresponding and derivative distinction
between natural and positive law, comes to us from Greek
philosophy. Natural justice is <span lang="grc">φυσικὸν δίκαιον</span>; positive
justice is <span lang="grc">νομικὸν δίκαιον</span>; and the natural law which expresses
the principles of natural justice is <span lang="grc">φυσικὸς νόμος</span>.
When Greek philosophy passed from Athens to Rome,
<span lang="grc">φυσικὸν δίκαιον</span> appeared there as <i><span lang="la">justitia naturalis</span></i> and
<span lang="grc">φυσικὸς νόμος</span> as <i><span lang="la">lex naturae</span></i> or <i><span lang="la">jus naturale</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>This natural law was conceived by the Greeks as a body
of imperative rules imposed upon mankind by Nature, the
personified universe. The Stoics, more particularly, thought
of Nature or the Universe as a living organism, of which
the material world was the body, and of which the Deity
or the Universal Reason was the pervading, animating,
and governing soul; and natural law was the rule of
conduct laid down by this Universal Reason for the direction
of mankind.</p>

<p class='c006'>Natural law has received many other names expressive
of its divers qualities and aspects. It is Divine Law (<i><span lang="la">jus
divinum</span></i>)—the command of God imposed upon men—this
aspect of it being recognised in the pantheism of the Stoics,
and coming into the forefront of the conception, so soon as
natural law obtained a place in the philosophical system of
Christian writers. Natural law is also the Law of Reason,
as being established by that Reason by which the world is
governed, and also as being addressed to and perceived by the
rational nature of man. It is also the Unwritten Law (<i><span lang="la">jus
non scriptum</span></i>), as being written not on brazen tablets or on
pillars of stone, but solely by the finger of nature in the hearts
of men. It is also the Universal or Common Law (<span lang="grc">κοινος
νόμος</span>, <i><span lang="la">jus commune</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">jus gentium</span></i>), as being of universal
validity, the same in all places and binding on all peoples, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>not one thing at Athens and another at Rome, as are the civil
laws of states (<span lang="grc">ἴδιος νόμος</span>, <i><span lang="la">jus civile</span></i>). It is also the Eternal
Law (<i><span lang="la">lex aeterna</span></i>), as having existed from the commencement
of the world, uncreated and immutable. Lastly, in modern
times we find it termed the Moral Law, as being the expression
of the principles of morality.</p>

<p class='c006'>The term natural law, in the sense with which we are here
concerned, is now fallen almost wholly out of use. We speak
of the principles of natural justice, or of the rules of natural
morality, but seldom of the law of nature, and for this departure
from the established usage of ancient and medieval
speech there are at least two reasons. The first is that the
term natural law has become equivocal; for it is now used to
signify physical law—the expression of the uniformities of
nature. The second is that the term law, as applied to the
principles of natural justice, brings with it certain misleading
associations—suggestions of command, imposition, external
authority, legislation—which are not in harmony with the
moral philosophy of the present day.</p>

<p class='c019'>The following quotations illustrate sufficiently the ancient and medieval
conceptions of the law of nature:—</p>

<p class='c020'><em>Aristotle.</em>—“Law is either universal (<span lang="grc">κοινος νόμος</span>) or special (<span lang="grc">ἴδιος
νόμος</span>). Special law consists of the written enactments by which men
are governed. The universal law consists of those unwritten rules which
are recognised among all men.”<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c016'><sup>[45]</sup></a> “Right and wrong have been defined
by reference to two kinds of law.... Special law is that which is established
by each people for itself.... The universal law is that which is
conformable merely to Nature.”<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c016'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c020'><em>Cicero.</em>—“There is indeed a true law (<i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>), right reason, agreeing with
nature, diffused among all men, unchanging, everlasting.... It is not
allowable to alter this law, nor to derogate from it, nor can it be repealed.
We cannot be released from this law, either by the praetor or by the people,
nor is any person required to explain or interpret it. Nor is it one law at
Rome and another at Athens, one law to-day and another hereafter; but
the same law, everlasting and unchangeable, will bind all nations at all times;
and there will be one common lord and ruler of all, even God the framer and
proposer of this law.”<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c016'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span><em>Philo Judaeus.</em>—“The unerring law is right reason; not an ordinance
made by this or that mortal, a corruptible and perishable law, a lifeless law
written on lifeless parchment, or engraved on lifeless columns; but one
imperishable, and impressed by immortal Nature on the immortal mind.”<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c016'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c020'><em>Gaius.</em>—“All peoples that are ruled by laws and customs observe
partly law peculiar to themselves and partly law common to all mankind.
That which any people has established for itself is called <i><span lang="la">jus civile</span></i>, as being
law peculiar to that state (<i><span lang="la">jus proprium civitatis</span></i>). But that law which
natural reason establishes among all mankind is observed equally by all
peoples, and is for that reason called <i><span lang="la">jus gentium</span></i>.”<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c016'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c020'><em>Justinian.</em>—“Natural law (<i><span lang="la">jura naturalia</span></i>), which is observed equally
in all nations, being established by divine providence, remains for ever
settled and immutable; but that law which each state has established for
itself is often changed, either by legislation or by the tacit consent of the
people.”<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c016'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'><em>Hooker.</em>—“The law of reason or human nature is that which men
by discourse of natural reason have rightly found out themselves to be all
for ever bound unto in their actions.”<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c016'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c020'><em>Christian Thomasius.</em>—“Natural law is a divine law, written in the
hearts of all men, obliging them to do those things which are necessarily
consonant to the rational nature of mankind, and to refrain from those
things which are repugnant to it.”<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>The <span lang="la">Jus Gentium</span> of the Roman Lawyers.</span></h4>

<p class='c021'>It is a commonly received opinion, that <i><span lang="la">jus gentium</span></i>, although identified
as early as the time of Cicero with the <i><span lang="la">jus naturale</span></i> of the Greeks,
was in its origin and primary signification something quite distinct—a
product not of Greek philosophy but of Roman law. It is alleged that
<i><span lang="la">jus gentium</span></i> meant originally that system of civil and positive law which
was administered in Rome to aliens (<i><span lang="la">peregrini</span></i>), as opposed to the system
which was the exclusive birthright and privilege of Roman citizens (<i><span lang="la">jus
civile</span></i> or <i><span lang="la">jus quiritium</span></i>); that this <i><span lang="la">jus gentium</span></i>, being later in date than the
<i><span lang="la">jus civile</span></i>, was so much more reasonable and perfect that it came to be
identified with the law of reason itself, the <i><span lang="la">jus naturale</span></i> of the Greeks, and
so acquired a double meaning, (1) <i><span lang="la">jus gentium</span></i>, viz. <i><span lang="la">jus naturale</span></i>, and (2) <i><span lang="la">jus
gentium</span></i>, viz. that part of the positive law of Rome which was applicable to
aliens, and not merely to citizens. That the term <i><span lang="la">jus gentium</span></i> did possess
this double meaning cannot be doubted; but it may be gravely doubted
whether the true explanation of the fact is that which has just been set
forth. It would seem more probable that <i><span lang="la">jus gentium</span></i> was in its very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>origin synonymous with <i><span lang="la">jus naturale</span></i>—a philosophical or ethical, and not
a technical legal term—the Roman equivalent of the <span lang="grc">κοινος νόμος</span> of
Aristotle and the Greeks; and that the technical significance of the term
is secondary and derivative. <i><span lang="de">Jus gentium</span></i> came to mean not only the law
of nature—the principles of natural justice—but also a particular part of
the positive law of Rome, namely, that part which was derived from and in
harmony with those principles of natural justice, and which therefore was
applicable in Roman law courts to all men equally, whether <i><span lang="la">cives</span></i> or
<i><span lang="la">peregrini</span></i>. In the same way in England, the term equity, although
originally purely ethical and the mere equivalent of natural justice or <i><span lang="la">jus
naturae</span></i>, acquired a secondary, derivative, and technical use to signify a
particular portion of the civil law of England, namely, that portion which
was administered in the Court of Chancery, and which was called equity
because derived from equity in the original ethical sense.</p>

<p class='c019'>This, however, is not the place in which to enter into any detailed
examination of this very interesting and difficult problem in the history of
human ideas.<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c016'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 17. <b>Imperative Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Imperative law means any rule of action imposed upon men
by some authority which enforces obedience to it. In other
words an imperative law is a command which prescribes some
general course of action, and which is imposed and enforced
by superior power. The instrument of such enforcement—the
sanction of the law—is not necessarily physical force,
but may consist in any other form of constraint or compulsion
by which the actions of men may be determined. <i><span lang="la">Lex</span></i>,
says Pufendorf,<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c016'><sup>[54]</sup></a> <i><span lang="la">est decretum quo superior sibi subjectum
obligat, ut ad istius praescriptum actiones suas componat</span></i>. “A
law,” says Austin,<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c016'><sup>[55]</sup></a> “is a command which obliges a person
or persons to a course of conduct.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Laws of this kind are to be classified by reference to the
authority from which they proceed. They are in the first
place either divine or human. Divine laws consist of the
commands imposed by God upon man and enforced by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>threats of punishment in this world or in the next: for
example, the Ten Commandments.<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c016'><sup>[56]</sup></a> Human laws consist of
imperative rules imposed by men upon men, and they are of
three chief kinds, namely, civil law, the law of positive
morality, and the law of nations. Civil law consists (in
part at least, and in one of its aspects) of commands issued by
the state to its subjects, and enforced by its physical power.
Positive morality—the law of opinion or of reputation, as
Locke<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c016'><sup>[57]</sup></a> calls it—consists of the rules imposed by society upon
its members and enforced by public censure or disapprobation.
The law of nations or international law consists (in part at
least, and in one aspect) of rules imposed upon states by
the society of states, and enforced partly by international
opinion and partly by the threat of war.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many writers are content to classify the civil law as being,
essentially and throughout its whole compass, nothing more
than a particular form of imperative law. They consider
that it is a sufficient analysis and definition of civil law, to
say that it consists of the commands issued by the state to
its subjects, and enforced, if necessary, by the physical power
of the state. This may be termed the imperative or more
accurately the purely imperative theory of the civil law.
“The civil laws,” says Hobbes,<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c016'><sup>[58]</sup></a> “are the command of him,
who is endued with supreme power in the city” (that is, the
state, <i><span lang="la">civitas</span></i>) “concerning the future actions of his subjects.”
Similar opinions are expressed by Bentham<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c016'><sup>[59]</sup></a> and Austin,<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c016'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
and have in consequence been widely, though by no means
universally, accepted by English writers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>This imperative theory, though it falls short of an adequate
analysis, does undoubtedly express a very important aspect of
the truth. It rightly emphasises the central fact that law is
based on physical force. For law exists only as an incident
of the administration of justice by the state, and this consists
essentially in the imperative and coercive action of the state
in imposing its will, by force if need be, upon the members
of the body politic. “It is men and arms,” says Hobbes,<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c016'><sup>[61]</sup></a>
“that make the force and power of the laws.” Law has its
sole source, not in custom, not in consent, not in the spirit
of the people, as some would have us believe, but in the will
and the power of him, who in a commonwealth beareth not
the sword in vain.</p>

<p class='c006'>This, then, may be accepted as the central truth contained
in the imperative theory of law, and if this is so there is no
weight to be attributed to that which may be termed the
historical argument against this theory. It is objected by
some, that though the definition of law as the command of
the state is plausible, and at first sight sufficient, as applied
to the developed political societies of modern times, it is
quite inapplicable to more primitive communities. Early
law, it is said, is not the command of the state; it has its
source in custom, religion, opinion, not in any authority
vested in a political superior; it is not till a comparatively
late stage of social evolution that law assumes its modern
form, and is recognised as a product of supreme power;
law, therefore, is prior to, and independent of political authority
and enforcement; it is enforced by the state, because
it is already law, not <i><span lang="la">vice versa</span></i>.<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c016'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>To this argument the advocates of the imperative theory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>can give a valid reply. If there are any rules prior to, and
independent of the state, they may greatly resemble law;
they may be the primeval substitutes for law; they may be
the historical source from which law is developed and proceeds;
but they are not themselves law. There may have
been a time in the far past, when a man was not distinguishable
from an anthropoid ape, but that is no reason for now
defining a man in such wise as to include an ape. To trace
two different things to a common origin in the beginnings of
their historical evolution is not to disprove the existence or
the importance of an essential difference between them as
they now stand. This is to confuse all boundary lines, to
substitute the history of the past for the logic of the present,
and to render all distinction and definition vain. The
historical point of view is valuable as a supplement to the
logical and analytical, but not as a substitute for it. It must
be borne in mind that in the beginning the whole earth was
without form and void, and that science is concerned not
with chaos but with cosmos.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plausibility of the historical argument proceeds from
the failure adequately to comprehend the distinction, hereafter
to be noticed by us, between the formal and the material
sources of law. Its formal source is that from which it
obtains the nature and force of law. This is essentially and
exclusively the power and will of the state. Its material
sources, on the other hand, are those from which it derives
its material contents. Custom and religion may be the
material sources of a legal system no less than that express
declaration of new legal principles by the state, which
we term legislation. In early times, indeed, legislation may
be unknown. No rule of law may as yet have been formulated
in any declaration of the state. It may not yet have
occurred to any man, that such a process as legislation is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>possible, and no ruler may ever yet have made a law.
Custom and religion may be all-powerful and exclusive.
Nevertheless if any rule of conduct has already put on
the true nature, form, and essence of the civil law, it is
because it has already at its back the power of the organised
commonwealth for the maintenance and enforcement of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet although the imperative theory contains this element
of the truth, it is not the whole truth. It is one-sided and
inadequate—the product of an incomplete analysis of juridical
conceptions. In the first place it is defective inasmuch as
it disregards that <em>ethical</em> element which is an essential constituent
of the complete conception. As to any special
relation between law and justice, this theory is silent and
ignorant. It eliminates from the implication of the term
law all elements save that of force. This is an illegitimate
simplification, for the complete idea contains at least one
other element which is equally essential and permanent.
This is right or justice. If rules of law are from one point
of view commands issued by the state to its subjects, from
another standpoint they appear as the principles of right and
wrong so far as recognised and enforced by the state in the
exercise of its essential function of administering justice.
Law is not right alone, or might alone, but the perfect union
of the two. It is justice speaking to men by the voice of
the state. The established law, indeed, may be far from
corresponding accurately with the true rule of right, nor is
its legal validity in any way affected by any such imperfection.
Nevertheless in <em>idea</em> law and justice are coincident.
It is for the expression and realisation of justice that the law
has been created, and like every other work of men’s hands,
it must be defined by reference to its end and purpose. A
purely imperative theory, therefore, is as one-sided as a
purely ethical or non-imperative theory would be. It mistakes
a part of the connotation of the term defined for the
whole of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>We should be sufficiently reminded of this ethical element
by the usages of popular speech. The terms law and justice
are familiar associates. Courts of law are also courts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>justice, and the administration of justice is also the enforcement
of law. Right, wrong, and duty are leading terms of
law, as well as of morals. If we turn from our own to
foreign languages, we find that law and right are usually
called by the very same name. <i><span lang="la">Jus</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i>, <i><span lang="de">recht</span></i>, <i><span lang="it">diritto</span></i>, have
all a double meaning; they are all ethical, as well as juridical;
they all include the rules of justice, as well as those of
law. Are these facts, then, of no significance? Are we to
look on them as nothing more than accidental and meaningless
coincidences of speech? It is this that the advocates of
the theory in question would have us believe. We may, on
the contrary, assume with confidence that these relations
between the names of things are but the outward manifestation
of very real and intimate relations between the things
named. A theory which regards the law as the command
of the state and nothing more, and which entirely ignores the
aspect of law as a public declaration of the principles of
justice, would lose all its plausibility, if expressed in a
language in which the term for law signifies justice also.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even if we incorporate the missing ethical element in the
definition—even if we define the law as the sum of the
principles of justice recognised and enforced by the state—even
if we say with Blackstone<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c016'><sup>[63]</sup></a> that law is “a rule of civil
conduct, prescribed by the supreme power in a state, commanding
what is right and prohibiting what is wrong”—we
shall not reach the whole truth. For although the idea of
command or enforcement is an essential implication of the
law, in the sense that there can be no law where there is no
coercive administration of justice by the state, it is not true
that every legal principle assumes, or can be made to assume,
the form of a command. Although the imperative rules of
right and wrong, as recognised by the state, constitute a
part, and indeed the most important part of the law, they do
not constitute the whole of it. The law includes the whole
of the principles accepted and applied in the administration
of justice, whether they are imperative principles or not.
The only legal rules which conform to the imperative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>definition are those which create legal obligations, and no
legal system consists exclusively of rules of this description.
All well-developed bodies of law contain innumerable
principles which have some other purpose and content than
this, and so fall outside the scope of the imperative definition.
These non-imperative legal principles are of various kinds.
There are, for example, permissive rules of law, namely those
which declare certain acts not to be obligatory, or not to be
wrongful; a rule, for instance, declaring that witchcraft or
heresy is no crime, or that damage done by competition in
trade is no cause of action. It cannot be denied that these
are rules of law, as that term is ordinarily used, and it is
plain that they fall within the definition of the law as the
principles acted on by courts of justice. But in what sense
are they enforced by the state? They are not commands,
but permissions; they create liberties, not obligations. So
also the innumerable rules of judicial procedure are largely
non-imperative. They are in no proper sense rules of
conduct enforced by the state. Let us take for example
the principles that hearsay is no evidence, that written
evidence is superior to verbal, that a contract for the sale of
land cannot be proved except by writing, that judicial notice
will be taken of such and such facts, that matters once
decided are decided once for all as between the same parties,
that the interpretation of written documents is the office of
the judge and not of the jury, that witnesses must be
examined on oath or affirmation, that the verdict of a jury
must be unanimous. Is it not plain that all these are in
their true nature rules in accordance with which judges administer
justice to the exclusion of their personal judgment,
and not rules of action appointed by the state for observance
by its subjects, and enforced by legal sanctions?</p>

<p class='c007'>There are various other forms of non-imperative law,
notably those which relate to the existence, application, and
interpretation of other rules. The illustrations already given,
however, should be sufficient to render evident the fact that
the purely imperative theory not merely neglects an essential
element in the idea of law, but also falls far short of the full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>application or denotation of the term. All legal principles
are not commands of the state, and those which are such
commands, are at the same time and in their essential nature
something more, of which the imperative theory takes no
account.</p>

<p class='c019'>Some writers have endeavoured to evade the foregoing objection by
regarding rules of procedure and all other non-imperative principles as
being in reality commands addressed, not to the ordinary subjects of the
state, but to the judges. The rule, they say, that murder is a crime,
is a command addressed to all persons not to commit murder; and the
rule that the punishment of murder is hanging, is a command to the judges
to inflict that punishment.<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c016'><sup>[64]</sup></a> With respect to this contention, it is to be
observed in the first place, that no delegation of its judicial functions by
the supreme authority of the state is essential. There is no reason of
necessity, why a despotic monarch or even a supreme legislature should not
personally exercise judicial functions. In such a case the rules of procedure
could not be enforced upon the judicature, yet it could scarcely be contended
that they would for that reason cease to be true rules of law. And
in the second place, even when the judicial functions of the state are
delegated to subordinate judges, it is in no way necessary that they should
be amenable to the law for the due performance of their duties. Are the
rules of evidence, for example, entitled to the name of law, only because
of the fact, if fact it be, that the judges who administer them may be
legally punished for their disregard of them? It is surely sufficiently
obvious that the legal character of all such rules is a consequence of the fact
that they are <em>actually observed</em> in the administration of justice, not of the
fact, if it is a fact, that the judicature is bound by legal sanctions to observe
them.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 18. <b>Conventional Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>By conventional law is meant any rule or system of rules
agreed upon by persons for the regulation of their conduct
towards each other. Agreement is a law for the parties to it.
Examples are the rules and regulations of a club or other
society, and the laws of whist, cricket, or any other game.
What are the laws of whist, except the rules which the players
expressly or tacitly agree to observe in their conduct of the
game?</p>

<p class='c006'>In many cases conventional law is also civil law; for the
rules which persons by mutual agreement lay down for themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>are often enforced by the state. But whether or not
these conventional rules thus receive recognition and enforcement
as part of the law of the land, they constitute law
in the wide sense of a rule of human action.<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c016'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The most important branch of conventional law is the law
of nations, which, as we shall see later, consists essentially of
the rules which have been agreed upon by states, as governing
their conduct and relations to each other.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 19. <b>Customary Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>By customary law is here meant any rule of action which
is actually observed by men—any rule which is the expression
of some actual uniformity of voluntary action. Custom
is a law for those who observe it—a law or rule which they
have set for themselves, and to which they voluntarily conform
their actions. It is true that custom is very often
obligatory; that is to say, it is very often enforced by some
form of imperative law, whether the civil law or the law of
positive morality; but, irrespective of any such enforcement,
and by reason solely of its <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> observance, it is itself a
law in that wide sense in which law means a rule of action.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c016'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Some writers regard international law as a form of customary
law. They define it as consisting of the rules actually
observed by states in their conduct towards each other. We
shall consider this opinion in a later section of the present
chapter. Civil law, as we have defined it, is a form of customary
law, inasmuch as it consists of the rules actually
observed by the state in the administration of justice. It is
the custom of the judicature. The relation between <em>popular</em>
custom and the civil law is an important matter which will be
considered in a later chapter. It is sufficient here to make the
following remarks with regard to it:—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>(1) Popular custom has not in itself the nature of civil
law; for the essence of civil law lies in its recognition by the
state in the administration of justice.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) Popular custom is one of the primitive substitutes for
civil law, men being governed by custom before the state has
been established or has undertaken the function of making
and administering law.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) Popular custom is one of the sources of the civil law;
for that law, when it comes into existence, is largely modelled
on the pre-existing customs of the community. Civil law,
which is the custom of the state, is based to a large extent
on that precedent customary law which is merely the custom
of the society.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 20. <b>Practical Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Yet another kind of law is that which consists of rules for
the attainment of some practical end, and which, for want of
a better name, we may term practical law. These laws are
the rules which guide us to the fulfilment of our purposes;
which inform us as to what we ought to do, or must do, in
order to attain a certain end.<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c016'><sup>[67]</sup></a> Examples of such are the laws
of health, the laws of musical and poetical composition, the
laws of style, the laws of architecture, the rules for the
efficient conduct of any art or business. The laws of a game,
such as whist, are of two kinds: some are conventional, being
the rules agreed upon by the players; others are practical,
being the rules for the successful playing of the game.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 21. <b>International Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>International law or the law of nations consists of those
rules which govern sovereign states in their relations and
conduct towards each other. All men agree that such a
body of law exists, and that states do in fact act in obedience
to it; but when we come to inquire what is the essential
nature and source of this law, we find in the writings of those
who deal with it a very curious absence of definiteness and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>unanimity. The opinion which we shall here adopt as correct
is that the law of nations is essentially a species of <em>conventional</em>
law—that it has its source in international agreement—that
it consists of the rules which sovereign states
have agreed to observe in their dealings with each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>This law has been defined by Lord Russell of Killowen<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c016'><sup>[68]</sup></a>
as “the aggregate of the rules to which nations have agreed
to conform in their conduct towards one another.” “The
law of nations,” says Lord Chief Justice Coleridge,<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c016'><sup>[69]</sup></a> “is that
collection of usages which civilised states have agreed to
observe in their dealings with each other.” “The authorities
seem to me,” says Lord Esher,<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c016'><sup>[70]</sup></a> “to make it clear that the
consent of nations is requisite to make any proposition part
of the law of nations.” “To be binding,” says Lord Cockburn,<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c016'><sup>[71]</sup></a>
“the law must have received the assent of the nations
who are to be bound by it. This assent may be express, as
by treaty or the acknowledged concurrence of governments,
or may be implied from established usage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The international agreement which thus makes international
law is of two kinds, being either express or implied.
Express agreement is contained in treaties and international
conventions, such as the Declaration of Paris or the Convention
of the Hague. Implied agreement is evidenced chiefly
by the custom or practice of states. By observing certain
rules of conduct in the past, states have impliedly agreed to
abide by them in the future; by claiming the observance of
such customs from other states, they have impliedly agreed
to be bound by them themselves. International law derived
from express agreement is called in a narrow sense the conventional
law of nations, although in a wider sense the
whole of that law is conventional; that part which is based
on implied agreement is called the customary law of nations.
The tendency of historical development is for the whole body
of the law to be reduced to the first of these two forms—to
be codified and expressed in the form of an international
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>convention, to which all civilised states have given their
express consent. Just as customary civil law tends to be
absorbed in enacted law, so customary international law
tends to be merged in treaty law.</p>

<p class='c006'>International law is further divisible into two kinds, which
may be distinguished as the common law of nations and the
particular law of nations. The common law is that which
prevails universally or at least generally among all civilised
states, being based on their unanimous or general agreement,
express or implied. The particular law is that which is in
force solely between two or more states, by virtue of an agreement
made between them alone, and derogating from the
common law.</p>

<p class='c007'>International law exists only between those states which
have expressly or impliedly agreed to observe it. Those
states (which now include all civilised communities and some
which are as yet only imperfectly civilised) are said to constitute
the family or society of nations—an international
society governed by the law of nations, just as each national
society is governed by its own civil law. New states are received
into this society by mutual agreement, and thereby
obtain the rights and become subject to the duties created
and imposed by international law.</p>

<p class='c006'>Writers are, however, as we have already indicated, far
from being unanimous in their analysis of the essential nature
of the law of nations, and the various competing theories
may be classified as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) That the law of nations is, or at least includes, a branch
of <em>natural</em> law, namely, the rules of natural justice as applicable
to the relations of states <i><span lang="la">inter se</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) That it is a kind of <em>customary</em> law, namely the rules
actually observed by states in their relations to each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) That it is a kind of <em>imperative</em> law, namely the rules
enforced upon states by international opinion or by the threat
or fear of war.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>(4) That it is a kind of <em>conventional</em> law, as already explained.
Having accepted the last of these theories as
correct, let us shortly consider the nature and claims of the
three others.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 22. <b>The Law of Nations as Natural Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>All writers on international law may be divided into three
classes by reference to their opinions as to the relation
between this law and the principles of natural justice. The
first class consists of those who hold that the law of nations
is wholly included within the law of nature—that it consists
merely of the principles of natural justice so far as applicable
to sovereign states in their relations and conduct towards
each other—that the study of international law is simply a
branch of moral philosophy—and that there is no such thing
as a positive law of nations, consisting of a body of artificial
rules established by states themselves. Thus Hobbes says:<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c016'><sup>[72]</sup></a>
“As for the law of nations, it is the same with the law of
nature. For that which is the law of nature between man
and man, before the constitution of commonwealth, is the
law of nations between sovereign and sovereign after.” The
same opinion is expressed by Christian Thomasius,<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c016'><sup>[73]</sup></a> Pufendorf,<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c016'><sup>[74]</sup></a>
Burlamaqui,<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c016'><sup>[75]</sup></a> and others, but is now generally discredited,
though it is not destitute of support even yet.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second opinion is that international law is both natural
and positive—that it is divisible into two parts, distinguished
as the natural law of nations, which consists of the rules of
natural justice as between states, and the positive law of
nations, consisting of rules established by states by agreement,
custom, or in some other manner, for the government
of their conduct towards each other. The natural law of
nations is supplementary or subsidiary to the positive law,
being applicable only when no positive rule has been established
on the point. Representatives of this opinion are
Grotius, Wolf, Vattel, Blackstone, Halleck, Wheaton,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Phillimore, Fiore, Twiss, and others. The third opinion is
that international law is wholly positive—that it consists exclusively
of a set of rules actually established in some way by
the action of sovereign states themselves—and that the rules
of natural justice are not in themselves rules of international
law at all, but pertain to that law only if, and only so far as,
they have been actually incorporated into the established
system of positive law. This is now the prevalent opinion,
and we have here accepted it as the correct one.<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c016'><sup>[76]</sup></a> By those
who maintain it the rules of natural justice as between states
are called international morality, and are distinguished by
this name from international law. These two bodies of rules
are partly coincident and partly discordant. The conduct
of a state may be a breach of international morality but not
of international law, or a breach of law though in accordance
with morality, or it may be both immoral and illegal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The question whether rules of natural justice are to be included
as a part of international law is, indeed, in one aspect,
a mere question of words. For these rules exist, and states
are in honour bound by them, and the question is merely as
to the name to be given to them. Nevertheless, questions
of words are often questions of practical importance, and it
is of undoubted importance to emphasise by a difference of
nomenclature the difference between rules of international
morality, by which, indeed, states are bound whether they
have agreed to them or not, but which are uncertain and
subject to endless dispute, and those rules of international
law, which by means of international agreement have been
defined and established and removed from the sphere of the
discussions and insoluble doubts of moral casuistry.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 23. <b>The Law of Nations as Customary Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Even those writers who agree in the opinion that international
law is or at least includes a system of positive law,
differ among themselves as to the essential nature and source
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of these rules; and we proceed to consider the various
answers that have been given to this question. Some
writers consider that international law has its source in international
custom—that it consists essentially and exclusively
of the rules which are actually observed by sovereign states
in their dealings with one another.<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c016'><sup>[77]</sup></a> This view, however, is
not prevalent, and is, it is believed, unsound. International
custom is not in itself international law; it is nothing more
than one kind of evidence of the international agreement in
which all such law has its source. There are many customs
which, because they are based on no such underlying agreement,
have not the force of law, states being at liberty to
depart from them when they please. Conversely there is
much law which is not based on custom at all, but on express
international conventions. These conventions, if observed,
will of course create a custom in conformity with the law;
but they constitute law themselves from the time of their
first making, and do not wait to become law until they have
been embodied in actual practice. New rules of warfare established
by convention in time of peace are law already in time
of peace.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 24. <b>The Law of Nations as Imperative Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>By some writers international law is regarded as a form of
imperative law; it consists, they say, of rules enforced upon
states by the general opinion of the society of states, and also
in extreme cases by war waged against the offender by the
state injured or by its allies. Thus Austin says:<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c016'><sup>[78]</sup></a> “Laws or
rules of this species, which are imposed upon nations or
sovereigns by opinions current among nations, are usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>styled the law of nations or international law.” In considering
this view it is to be admitted that in many cases the rules
of the law of nations are thus sanctioned and enforced by
international opinion and force. But the question to be
answered is whether this sanction is of the essence of the
matter; because, if it is so, all rules so sanctioned must be,
and no others can be, rules of international law. It is clear,
however, that the sanction of war cannot be the essential
test; for in the first place this sanction is but seldom applied
even to undoubted violations of international law, and in the
second place it is at least as often resorted to when there is
no violation of such law at all. What then shall be said of
the alternative sanction of international opinion? Is this
the test and essence of a rule of international law? For the
following reasons it is submitted that it is not:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) Many forms of state action are censured by public
opinion, which are admittedly no violation of the law of
nations. A state may act within its legal rights, and yet so
oppressively or unjustly as to excite the adverse opinion of
other nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) There may be violations of international law which
are in the particular circumstances regarded as excusable,
and approved by international opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) Public opinion is variable from day to day—dependent
on the special circumstances of the individual case—not
uniform as we pass from state to state—not uniform even
throughout the population of the same state. International
law, on the other hand, is a permanent, uniform system of
settled rules, independent of the fickle breath of public
approbation or censure—made and unmade by the express
or implied agreements of sovereign governments, and not by
the mere opinions and prejudices which for the moment are
in public favour. International law is one thing, international
positive morality is another thing; but the doctrine
here criticised identifies and confounds them as one. International
law is made, as has been said, by the acts and contracts
of governments; international opinion is made chiefly
by journalists and the writers of books. Opinion, if sufficiently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>uniform and sufficiently permanent, will doubtless in
time constrain the law into conformity with it; but it is not
the same thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) Public opinion cannot be made the basis of any rational
or scientific body of rules or legal doctrines. For such opinion
is simply the belief of the public that certain forms of conduct
are in conformity with natural justice. So far as this
belief is well founded, the law based upon it is simply the law
of nature; so far as it is erroneous, the law based on it is
simply a mistake which disappears <i><span lang="la">ipso facto</span></i> on being recognised
as such. It is impossible to recognise as a subject of
scientific interpretation and investigation any international
law based on erroneous public opinion; and if based on
true opinion, it is nothing save the principles of natural
justice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Certain writers seek to avoid the first of these objections
by so defining international law as to include only one
portion of the body of rules approved and sanctioned by
international opinion, the remaining portion constituting
international positive morality. According to this opinion
international law consists of those rules which international
opinion not merely approves, but also regards as rightly
enforceable by way of war. International positive morality,
on the other hand, consists of those rules of which opinion
approves, but of the enforcement of which by way of war it
would not approve. That is to say, international law is
distinguished from international morality by an application
of the distinction familiar to the older moralists between
duties of perfect and duties of imperfect obligation.<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c016'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This view would seem to be exposed to all the objections
already made to the cruder theory which we have just considered,
with the exception of the first; and it is also exposed
to this further criticism, that it is impossible thus to divide
public opinion sharply into two parts by reference to the
justification of war or any other kind of forcible compulsion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Whether such compulsion is right is a matter to be determined
not by the application of any fixed or predetermined
rules, but by a consideration of all the circumstances of the
individual instance; and even then opinion will in most cases
be hopelessly discordant. Moreover, there are forms of state
action which are not the violation of any established rule of
international law, and which nevertheless are so contrary to
the rightful interests of another state that they would be
held to be rightly prevented or redressed by way of war.
Conversely there are rules of undoubted law which are of
such minor importance, that a war for the vindication of
them would be viewed by international opinion as a folly
and a crime.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='c013'>THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 25. <b>Necessity of the Administration of Justice.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>“A herd of wolves,” it has been said,<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c016'><sup>[80]</sup></a> “is quieter and more
at one than so many men, unless they all had one reason in
them, or have one power over them.” Unfortunately they
have not one reason in them, each being moved by his own
interests and passions; therefore the other alternative is the
sole resource. For the cynical emphasis with which he insists
upon this truth, the name and reputation of the philosopher
Hobbes have suffered much. Yet his doctrine, however
hyperbolically expressed, is true in substance. Man is by
nature a fighting animal, and force is the <i><span lang="la">ultima ratio</span></i>, not of
kings alone, but of all mankind. Without “a common power
to keep them all in awe,” it is impossible for men to cohere
in any but the most primitive forms of society. Without
it, civilisation is unattainable, injustice is unchecked and
triumphant, and the life of man is, as the author of <em>Leviathan</em>
tells us, “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c016'><sup>[81]</sup></a> However
orderly a society may be, and to whatever extent men
may appear to obey the law of reason rather than that of force,
and to be bound together by the bonds of sympathy rather
than by those of physical constraint, the element of force is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>none the less present and operative. It has become partly
or wholly latent, but it still exists. A society in which the
power of the state is never called into actual exercise marks
not the disappearance of governmental control, but the final
triumph and supremacy of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been thought and said by men of optimistic temper,
that force as an instrument for the coercion of mankind is
merely a temporary and provisional incident in the development
of a perfect civilisation. We may well believe, indeed,
that with the progress of civilisation we shall see the gradual
cessation of the actual exercise of force, whether by way of
the administration of justice or by way of war. To a large
extent already, in all orderly societies, this element in the
administration of justice has become merely latent; it is
now for the most part sufficient for the state to declare the
rights and duties of its subjects, without going beyond
declaration to enforcement. In like manner the future may
see a similar destiny overtake that international litigation
which now so often proceeds to the extremity of war. The
overwhelming power of the state or of the international
society of states may be such as to render its mere existence
a sufficient substitute for its exercise. But this, as already
said, would be the perfection, not the disappearance, of the
rule of force. The administration of justice by the state
must be regarded as a permanent and essential element of
civilisation, and as a device that admits of no substitute.
Men being what they are, their conflicting interests, real or
apparent, draw them in diverse ways; and their passions
prompt them to the maintenance of these interests by all
methods possible, notably by that method of private force to
which the public force is the only adequate reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>The constraint of public opinion is a valuable and indeed
indispensable supplement to that of law, but an entirely
insufficient substitute for it. The relation between these
two is one of mutual dependence. If the administration of
justice requires for its efficiency the support of a healthy
national conscience, that conscience is in its turn equally
dependent on the protection of the law and the public force.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>A coercive system based on public opinion alone, no less than
one based on force alone, contains within itself elements of
weakness that would be speedily fatal to efficiency and permanence.
The influence of the public censure is least felt by
those who need it most. The law of force is appointed, as
all law should be, not for the just, but for the unjust; while
the law of opinion is set rather for the former than for the
latter, and may be defied with a large measure of impunity by
determined evildoers. The rewards of successful iniquity
are upon occasion very great; so much so that any law which
would prevail against it, must have sterner sanctions at its
back than any known to the public censure. It is also to be
observed that the influence of the national conscience, unsupported
by that of the national force, would be counteracted
in any but the smallest and most homogeneous societies
by the internal growth of smaller societies or associations
possessing separate interests and separate antagonistic consciences
of their own. It is certain that a man cares more
for the opinion of his friends and immediate associates, than
for that of all the world besides. The censure of ten thousand
may be outweighed by the approval of ten. The honour of
thieves finds its sanction and support in a law of professional
opinion, which is opposed to, and prevails over that of
national opinion. The social sanction, therefore, is an
efficient instrument only so far as it is associated with, and
supplemented by the concentrated and irresistible force of
the incorporate community. Men being what they are—each
keen to see his own interest and passionate to follow it—society
can exist only under the shelter of the state, and
the law and justice of the state is a permanent and necessary
condition of peace, order, and civilisation.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 26. <b>Origin of the Administration of Justice.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The administration of justice is the modern and civilised
substitute for the primitive practices of private vengeance
and violent self-help. In the beginning a man redressed his
wrongs and avenged himself upon his enemies by his own
hand, aided, if need be, by the hands of his friends and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>kinsmen; but at the present day he is defended by the
sword of the state. For the expression of this and other
elements involved in the establishment of political government,
we may make use of the contrast, familiar to the
philosophy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, between
the civil state and the state of nature. This state of
nature is now commonly rejected as one of the fictions which
nourished in the era of the social contract, but such treatment
is needlessly severe. The term certainly became associated
with much false or exaggerated doctrine touching the golden
age on the one hand and the <i><span lang="la">bellum omnium contra omnes</span></i> of
Hobbes on the other, but in itself it nevertheless affords a
convenient mode for the expression of an undoubted truth.
As long as there have been men, there has probably been some
form of human society. The state of nature, therefore, is not
the absence of society, but the absence of a society so
organised on the basis of physical force, as to constitute a
state. Though human society is coeval with mankind, the
rise of political society, properly so called, is an event in
human history.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most important elements, then, in the transition
from the natural to the civil state is the substitution of
the force of the incorporate community for the force of individuals,
as the instrument of the redress and punishment of
injuries. Private vengeance is transmuted into the administration
of criminal justice; while civil justice takes the place
of violent self-help. As Locke says,<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c016'><sup>[82]</sup></a> in the state of nature
the law of nature is alone in force, and every man is in his
own case charged with the execution of it. In the civil state,
on the other hand, the law of nature is supplemented by the
civil law, and the maintenance of the latter by the force of
the organised community renders unnecessary and impermissible
the maintenance of the former by the forces of private
men. The evils of the earlier system were too great and
obvious to escape recognition even in the most primitive
communities. Every man was constituted by it a judge in
his own cause, and might was made the sole measure of right.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Nevertheless the substitution was effected only with difficulty
and by slow degrees. The turbulent spirits of early
society did not readily abandon the liberty of fighting out
their quarrels, or submit with good grace to the arbitrament
of the tribunals of the state. There is much evidence that
the administration of justice was in the earlier stages of its
development merely a choice of peaceable arbitration, offered
for the voluntary acceptance of the parties, rather than a
compulsory substitute for self-help and private war. Only
later, with the gradual growth of the power of government,
did the state venture to suppress with the strong hand the
ancient and barbarous system, and to lay down the peremptory
principle that all quarrels shall be brought for settlement
to the courts of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>All early codes show us traces of the hesitating and gradual
method in which the voice and force of the state became the
exclusive instruments of the declaration and enforcement
of justice. Trial by battle, which endured in the law of
England until the beginning of the nineteenth century,<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c016'><sup>[83]</sup></a> is
doubtless a relic of the days when fighting was the approved
method of settling a dispute, and the right and power of the
state went merely to the regulation, not to the suppression, of
this right and duty of every man to help and guard himself by
his own hand. In later theory, indeed, this mode of trial was
classed with the ordeal as <em>judicium Dei</em>—the judgment of
Heaven as to the merits of the case, made manifest by the
victory of the right. But this explanation was an afterthought;
it was applied to public war, as the litigation of
nations, no less than to the judicial duel, and it is not the root
of either practice. Among the laws of the Saxon kings we
find no absolute prohibition of private vengeance, but merely
its regulation and restriction.<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c016'><sup>[84]</sup></a> In due measure and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>fitting manner it was the right of every man to do for himself
that which in modern times is done for him by the state. As
royal justice grows in strength, however, the law begins to
speak in another tone, and we see the establishment of the
modern theory of the exclusive administration of justice by
the tribunals of the state.<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c016'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 27. <b>Civil and Criminal Justice.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The administration of justice has been already defined as
the maintenance of right within a political community by
means of the physical force of the state. It is the application
by the state of the sanction of force to the rule of right. We
have now to notice that it is divisible into two parts, which
are distinguished as the administration of civil and that of
criminal justice. In applying the sanction of physical force
to the rules of right, the tribunals of the state may act in one
or other of two different ways. They may either enforce
rights, or punish wrongs. In other words, they may either
compel a man to perform the duty which he owes, or they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>may punish him for having failed to perform it. Hence the
distinction between civil and criminal justice. The former
consists in the enforcement of rights, the latter in the punishment
of wrongs. In a civil proceeding the plaintiff claims a
right, and the court secures it for him by putting pressure
upon the defendant to that end; as when one claims a debt
that is due to him, or the restoration of property wrongfully
detained from him, or damages payable to him by way of
compensation for wrongful harm, or the prevention of a
threatened injury by way of injunction. In a criminal proceeding,
on the other hand, the prosecutor claims no right,
but accuses the defendant of a wrong. He is not a claimant,
but an accuser. The court makes no attempt to constrain the
defendant to perform any duty, or to respect any right. It
visits him, instead, with a penalty for the duty already disregarded
and for the right already violated; as where he is
hanged for murder, or imprisoned for theft.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both in civil and in criminal proceedings there is a <em>wrong</em>
(actual or threatened) complained of. For the law will not
enforce a right except as against a person who has already
violated it, or who has at the least already shown an intention
of doing so. Justice is administered only against wrongdoers,
in act or in intent. Yet the complaint is of an essentially
different character in civil and in criminal cases. In civil
justice it amounts to a claim of right; in criminal justice it
amounts merely to an accusation of wrong. Civil justice is
concerned primarily with the plaintiff and his rights;
criminal justice with the defendant and his offences. The
former gives to the plaintiff, the latter to the defendant, that
which he deserves.</p>

<p class='c007'>A wrong regarded as the subject-matter of civil proceedings
is called a civil wrong; one regarded as the subject-matter of
criminal proceedings is termed a criminal wrong or a crime.
The position of a person who has, by actual or threatened
wrongdoing, exposed himself to legal proceedings, is termed
liability or responsibility, and it is either civil or criminal
according to the nature of the proceedings to which the
wrongdoer is exposed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>The same act may be both a civil injury and a crime, both
forms of legal remedy being available. Reason demands that
in general these two remedies shall be concurrent, and not
merely alternative. If possible, the law should not only
compel men to perform their disregarded duties, but should
by means of punishment guard against the repetition of such
wrongdoing in the future. The thief should not only be compelled
to restore his plunder, but should also be imprisoned
for having taken it, lest he and others steal again. To this
duplication of remedies, however, there are numerous exceptions.
Punishment is the sole resource in cases where
enforcement is from the nature of things impossible, and
enforcement is the sole remedy in those cases in which it is
itself a sufficient precautionary measure for the future. Not
to speak of the defendant’s liability for the costs of the proceedings,
the civil remedy of enforcement very commonly
contains, as we shall see later, a penal element which is
sufficient to render unnecessary or unjustifiable any cumulative
criminal responsibility.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have defined a criminal proceeding as one designed for
the punishment of a wrong done by the defendant, and a civil
proceeding as one designed for the enforcement of a right
vested in the plaintiff. We have now to consider a very
different explanation which has been widely accepted. By
many persons the distinction between crimes and civil
injuries is identified with that between public and private
wrongs. By a public wrong is meant an offence committed
against the state or the community at large, and dealt with
in a proceeding to which the state is itself a party. A private
wrong is one committed against a private person, and dealt
with at the suit of the individual so injured. The thief is
criminally prosecuted by the Crown, but the trespasser is
civilly sued by him whose right he has violated. Criminal
libel, it is said, is a public wrong, and is dealt with as such at
the suit of the Crown; civil libel is a private wrong and is
dealt with accordingly by way of an action for damages by the
person libelled. Blackstone’s statement of this view may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>taken as representative: “Wrongs,” he says,<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c016'><sup>[86]</sup></a> “are divisible
into two sorts or species, private wrongs and public wrongs.
The former are an infringement or privation of the private or
civil rights belonging to individuals, considered as individuals,
and are thereupon frequently termed civil injuries;
the latter are a breach and violation of public rights and
duties which affect the whole community considered as a
community; and are distinguished by the harsher appellation
of crimes and misdemeanours.”<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c016'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>But this explanation is insufficient. In the first place all
public wrongs are not crimes. A refusal to pay taxes is an
offence against the state, and is dealt with at the suit of the
state; but it is a civil wrong for all that, just as a refusal to
repay money lent by a private person is a civil wrong. The
breach of a contract made with the state is no more a criminal
offence than is the breach of a contract made with a subject.
An action by the state for the recovery of a debt, or for
damages, or for the restoration of public property, or for the
enforcement of a public trust, is purely civil, although in each
case the person injured and suing is the state itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conversely, and in the second place, all crimes are not
public wrongs. Most of the very numerous offences that are
now punishable on summary conviction may be prosecuted
at the suit of a private person; yet the proceedings are
undoubtedly criminal none the less.</p>

<p class='c007'>We must conclude, therefore, that the divisions between
public and private wrongs and between crimes and civil
injuries are not coincident but cross divisions. Public rights
are often enforced, and private wrongs are often punished.
The distinction between criminal and civil wrongs is based
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>not on any difference in the nature of the right infringed, but
on a difference in the nature of the remedy applied.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plausibility of the theory in question is chiefly attributable
to a certain peculiarity in the historical development
of the administration of justice. Where the criminal remedy
of punishment is left in the hands of the individuals injured,
to be claimed or not as they think fit, it invariably tends to
degenerate into the civil remedy of pecuniary compensation.
Men barter their barren rights of vengeance for the more
substantial solatium of coin of the realm. Offenders find no
difficulty in buying off the vengeance of those they have
offended, and a system of money payments by way of composition
takes the place of a system of true punishments.
Hence it is, that in primitive codes true criminal law is
almost unknown. Its place is taken by that portion of civil
law which is concerned with pecuniary redress. Murder,
theft, and violence are not crimes to be punished by loss of
life, limb, or liberty, but civil injuries to be paid for. This is a
well-recognised characteristic of the early law both of Rome
and England. In the Jewish law we notice an attempt to
check this process of substitution, and to maintain the law
of homicide, at least, as truly criminal. “Ye shall take no
satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death:
but he shall be surely put to death.”<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c016'><sup>[88]</sup></a> Such attempts, however,
will be for the most part vain, until the state takes upon
itself the office of prosecutor, and until offences worthy of
punishment cease to be matters between private persons, and
become matters between the wrongdoer and the community
at large. Only when the criminal has to answer for his deed
to the state itself, will true criminal law be successfully established
and maintained. Thus at Rome the more important
forms of criminal justice pertained to the sovereign assemblies
of the people, while civil justice was done in the courts
of the praetor and other magistrates. So in England indictable
crimes are in legal theory offences against “the peace of
our Lord the King, his crown and dignity,” and it was only
under the rule of royal justice that true criminal law was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>superadded to the more primitive system of pecuniary compensation.
Even at the present day, for the protection of
the law of crime, it is necessary to prohibit as itself a crime
the compounding of a felony, and to prevent in courts of
summary jurisdiction the settlement of criminal proceedings
by the parties without the leave of the court itself. Such
is the historical justification of the doctrine which identifies
the distinction between civil injuries and crimes with that
between public and private wrongs. The considerations
already adduced should be sufficient to satisfy us that the
justification is inadequate.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 28. <b>The Purposes of Criminal Justice; Deterrent Punishment.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The ends of criminal justice are four in number, and in
respect of the purposes so served by it, punishment may be
distinguished as (1) Deterrent, (2) Preventive, (3) Reformative,
and (4) Retributive. Of these aspects the first is the
essential and all-important one, the others being merely
accessory. Punishment is before all things deterrent, and
the chief end of the law of crime is to make the evildoer an
example and a warning to all that are like-minded with him.
Offences are committed by reason of a conflict between the
interests, real or apparent, of the wrongdoer and those of
society at large. Punishment prevents offences by destroying
this conflict of interests to which they owe their origin—by
making all deeds which are injurious to others injurious
also to the doers of them—by making every offence, in the
words of Locke, “an ill bargain to the offender.” Men do
injustice because they have no sufficient motive to seek
justice, which is the good of others rather than that of the
doer of it. The purpose of the criminal law is to supply
by art the motives which are thus wanting in the nature of
things.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 29. <b>Preventive Punishment.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Punishment is in the second place preventive or disabling.
Its primary and general purpose being to deter by fear, its
secondary and special purpose is, wherever possible and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>expedient, to prevent a repetition of wrongdoing by the disablement
of the offender. We hang murderers not merely
that we may put into the hearts of others like them the fear of
a like fate, but for the same reason for which we kill snakes,
namely, because it is better for us that they should be out of
the world than in it. A similar secondary purpose exists in
such penalties as imprisonment, exile, and forfeiture of office.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 30. <b>Reformative Punishment.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Punishment is in the third place reformative. Offences
are committed through the influence of motives upon character,
and may be prevented either by a change of motives
or by a change of character. Punishment as deterrent
acts in the former method; punishment as reformative in
the latter. This curative or medicinal function is practically
limited to a particular species of penalty, namely, imprisonment,
and even in this case pertains to the ideal rather than
to the actual. It would seem, however, that this aspect of the
criminal law is destined to increasing prominence. The new
science of criminal anthropology would fain identify crime
with disease, and would willingly deliver the criminal out of
the hands of the men of law into those of the men of medicine.
The feud between the two professions touching the
question of insanity threatens to extend itself throughout
the whole domain of crime.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is plain that there is a necessary conflict between the
deterrent and the reformative theories of punishment, and
that the system of criminal justice will vary in important
respects according as the former or the latter principle prevails
in it. The purely reformative theory admits only such
forms of punishment as are subservient to the education and
discipline of the criminal, and rejects all those which are
profitable only as deterrent or disabling. Death is in this
view no fitting penalty; we must cure our criminals, not kill
them. Flogging and other corporal inflictions are condemned
as relics of barbarism by the advocates of the new
doctrine; such penalties are said to be degrading and
brutalizing both to those who suffer and to those who inflict
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>them, and so fail in the central purpose of criminal justice.
Imprisonment, indeed, as already indicated, is the only important
instrument available for the purpose of a purely
reformative system. Even this, however, to be fitted for such
a purpose, requires alleviation to a degree quite inadmissible
in the alternative system. If criminals are sent to prison in
order to be there transformed into good citizens by physical,
intellectual, and moral training, prisons must be turned into
dwelling-places far too comfortable to serve as any effectual
deterrent to those classes from which criminals are chiefly
drawn. A further illustration of the divergence between the
deterrent and the reformative theories is supplied by the case
of incorrigible offenders. The most sanguine advocate of the
curative treatment of criminals must admit that there are in
the world men who are incurably bad, men who by some vice
of nature are even in their youth beyond the reach of reformative
influences, and with whom crime is not so much a bad
habit as an ineradicable instinct. What shall be done with
these? The only logical inference from the reformative
theory is that they should be abandoned in despair as no fit
subjects for penal discipline. The deterrent and disabling
theories, on the other hand, regard such offenders as being
pre-eminently those with whom the criminal law is called
upon to deal. That they may be precluded from further mischief,
and at the same time serve as a warning to others, they
are justly deprived of their liberty, and in extreme cases of
life itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The application of the purely reformative theory, therefore,
would lead to astonishing and inadmissible results. The perfect
system of criminal justice is based on neither the reformative
nor the deterrent principle exclusively, but is the result
of a compromise between them. In this compromise it is the
deterrent principle which possesses predominant influence,
and its advocates who have the last word. This is the primary
and essential end of punishment, and all others are
merely secondary and accidental. The present tendency to
attribute exaggerated importance to the reformative element
is a reaction against the former tendency to neglect it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>altogether, and like most reactions it falls into the falsehood
of extremes. It is an important truth, unduly neglected in
times past, that to a very large extent criminals are not
normal and healthy human beings, and that crime is in great
measure the product of physical and mental abnormality and
degeneracy. It has been too much the practice to deal with
offenders on the assumption that they are ordinary types of
humanity. Too much attention has been paid to the crime,
and too little to the criminal. Yet we must be careful not
to fall into the opposite extreme. If crime has become the
monopoly of the abnormal and the degenerate or even the
mentally unsound, the fact must be ascribed to the selective
influence of a system of criminal justice based on a sterner
principle than that of reformation. The more efficient the
coercive action of the state becomes, the more successful it is
in restraining all normal human beings from the dangerous
paths of crime, and the higher becomes the proportion of
degeneracy among those who break the law. Even with our
present imperfect methods the proportion of insane persons
among murderers is very high; but if the state could succeed
in making it impossible to commit murder in a sound mind
without being indubitably hanged for it afterwards, murder
would become, with scarcely an exception, limited to the
insane.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, after this consummation had been reached, the opinion
were advanced that inasmuch as all murderers are insane,
murder is not a crime which needs to be suppressed by the
strong arm of the penal law, and pertains to the sphere of
medicine rather than to that of jurisprudence, the fallacy of
the argument would be obvious. Were the state to act on
any such principle, the proposition that all murderers are
insane would very rapidly cease to be true. The same fallacy,
though in a less obvious form, is present in the more general
argument that, since the proportion of disease and degeneracy
among criminals is so great, the reformative function of
punishment should prevail over, and in a great measure
exclude, its deterrent and coercive functions. For it is chiefly
through the permanent influence and operation of these latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>functions, partly direct in producing a fear of evildoing, partly
indirect in establishing and maintaining those moral habits
and sentiments which are possible only under the shelter of
coercive law, that crime has become limited, in such measure
as it has, to the degenerate, the abnormal, and the insane.
Given an efficient penal system, crime is too poor a bargain
to commend itself, save in exceptional circumstances, to any
except those who lack the self-control, the intelligence, the
prudence, or the moral sentiments of the normal man. But
apart from criminal law in its sterner aspects, and apart from
that positive morality which is largely the product of it,
crime is a profitable industry, which will flourish exceedingly,
and be by no means left as a monopoly to the feebler and
less efficient members of society.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the general substitution of the reformative for
the deterrent principle would lead to disaster, it may be
argued that the substitution is possible and desirable in the
special case of the abnormal and degenerate. Purely reformative
treatment is now limited to the insane and the very
young; should it not be extended to include all those who
fall into crime through their failure to attain to the standard
of normal humanity? No such scheme, however, seems
practicable. In the first place, it is not possible to draw
any sharp line of distinction between the normal and the
degenerate human being. It is difficult enough in the only
case of degeneracy now recognised by the law, namely
insanity; but the difficulty would be a thousand-fold increased
had we to take account of every lapse from the
average type. The law is necessarily a rough and ready
instrument, and men must be content in general to be
judged and dealt with by it on the basis of their common
humanity, and not on that of their special idiosyncrasies.
In the second place, even in the case of those who are distinctly
abnormal, it does not appear, except in the special
instance of mental unsoundness, that the purely deterrent
influences of punishment are not effective and urgently
required. If a man is destitute of the affections and social
instincts of humanity, the judgment of common sense upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>him is not that he should be treated more leniently than
the normal evildoer—not that society should cherish him
in the hope of making him a good citizen—but that by the
rigour of penal discipline his fate should be made a terror
and a warning to himself and others. And in this matter
sound science approves the judgment of common sense.
Even in the case of the abnormal it is easier and more profitable
to prevent crime by the fear of punishment than to
procure by reformative treatment the repentance and
amendment of the criminal.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is needful, then, in view of modern theories and tendencies,
to insist on the primary importance of the deterrent
element in criminal justice. The reformative element must
not be overlooked, but neither must it be allowed to assume
undue prominence. To what extent it may be permitted in
particular instances to overrule the requirements of a strictly
deterrent theory is a question of time, place, and circumstance.
In the case of youthful criminals the chances of
effective reformation are greater than in that of adults, and
the rightful importance of the reformative principle is therefore
greater also. In orderly and law-abiding communities
concessions may be safely made in the interests of reformation,
which in more turbulent societies would be fatal to the
public welfare.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 31. <b>Retributive Punishment.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We have considered criminal justice in three of its aspects—namely
as deterrent, disabling, and reformative—and we
have now to deal with it under its fourth and last aspect as
retributive. Retributive punishment, in the only sense in
which it is admissible in any rational system of administering
justice, is that which serves for the satisfaction of that
emotion of retributive indignation which in all healthy communities
is stirred up by injustice. It gratifies the instinct
of revenge or retaliation, which exists not merely in the
individual wronged, but also by way of sympathetic extension
in the society at large. Although the system of private
revenge has been suppressed, the emotions and instincts that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>lay at the root of it are still extant in human nature, and it
is a distinct though subordinate function of criminal justice
to afford them their legitimate satisfaction. For although
in their lawless and unregulated exercise and expression
they are full of evil, there is in them none the less an
element of good. The emotion of retributive indignation,
both in its self-regarding and its sympathetic forms, is even
yet the mainspring of the criminal law. It is to the fact
that the punishment of the wrongdoer is at the same time
the vengeance of the wronged, that the administration of
justice owes a great part of its strength and effectiveness.
Did we punish criminals merely from an intellectual appreciation
of the expediency of so doing, and not because their
crimes arouse in us the emotion of anger and the instinct of
retribution, the criminal law would be but a feeble instrument.
Indignation against injustice is, moreover, one of the
chief constituents of the moral sense of the community, and
positive morality is no less dependent on it than is the law
itself. It is good, therefore, that such instincts and emotions
should be encouraged and strengthened by their satisfaction;
and in civilised societies this satisfaction is possible in any
adequate degree only through the criminal justice of the
state. There can be little question that at the present day
the sentiment of retributive indignation is deficient rather
than excessive, and requires stimulation rather than restraint.
Unquestionable as have been the benefits of that growth of
altruistic sentiment which characterises modern society, it
cannot be denied that in some respects it has taken a perverted
course and has interfered unduly with the sterner
virtues. A morbid sentimentality has made of the criminal
an object of sympathetic interest rather than of healthy
indignation, and Cain occupies in our regards a place that is
better deserved by Abel. We have too much forgotten that
the mental attitude which best becomes us, when fitting
justice is done upon the evildoer, is not pity, but solemn
exultation.<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c016'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>The foregoing explanation of retributive punishment as
essentially an instrument of vindictive satisfaction is by no
means that which receives universal acceptance. It is a very
widely held opinion that retribution is in itself, apart altogether
from any deterrent or reformative influences exercised
by it, a right and reasonable thing, and the just reward of
iniquity. According to this view, it is right and proper,
without regard to ulterior consequences, that evil should be
returned for evil, and that as a man deals with others so
should he himself be dealt with. An eye for an eye and a
tooth for a tooth is deemed a plain and self-sufficient rule of
natural justice. Punishment as so regarded is no longer a
mere instrument for the attainment of the public welfare, but
has become an end in itself. The purpose of vindictive satisfaction
has been eliminated without any substitute having
been provided. Those who accept this view commonly
advance retribution to the first place among the various
aspects of punishment, the others being relegated to subordinate
positions.</p>

<p class='c006'>This conception of retributive justice still retains a prominent
place in popular thought. It flourishes also in the
writings of theologians and of those imbued with theological
modes of thought, and even among the philosophers it does
not lack advocates. Kant, for example, expresses the
opinion that punishment cannot rightly be inflicted for the
sake of any benefit to be derived from it either by the
criminal himself or by society, and that the sole and sufficient
reason and justification of it lies in the fact that evil has been
done by him who suffers it.<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c016'><sup>[90]</sup></a> Consistently with this view, he
derives the measure of punishment, not from any elaborate
considerations as to the amount needed for the repression of
crime, but from the simple principle of the <i><span lang="la">lex talionis</span></i>:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>“Thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for
eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.”<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c016'><sup>[91]</sup></a> No such
principle, indeed, is capable of literal interpretation; but subject
to metaphorical and symbolical applications it is in
Kant’s view the guiding rule of the ideal scheme of criminal
justice.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is scarcely needful to observe that from the utilitarian
point of view hitherto taken up by us such a conception of
retributive punishment is totally inadmissible. Punishment
is in itself an evil, and can be justified only as the means of
attaining a greater good. Retribution is in itself not a
remedy for the mischief of the offence, but an aggravation of
it. The opposite opinion may be regarded as a product of
the incomplete transmutation of the conception of revenge
into that of punishment. It results from a failure to appreciate
the rational basis of the instinct of retribution—a
failure to refer the emotion of retributive indignation to the
true source of its rational justification—so that retaliation is
deemed an end in itself, and is regarded as the essential
element in the conception of penal justice.</p>

<p class='c006'>A more definite form of the idea of purely retributive
punishment is that of expiation. In this view, crime is done
away with, cancelled, blotted out, or expiated, by the suffering
of its appointed penalty. To suffer punishment is to pay
a debt due to the law that has been violated. Guilt <em>plus</em>
punishment is equal to innocence. “The wrong,” it has
been said,<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c016'><sup>[92]</sup></a> “whereby he has transgressed the law of right, has
incurred a debt. Justice requires that the debt be paid, that
the wrong be expiated.... This is the first object of punishment—to
make satisfaction to outraged law.” This conception,
like the preceding, marks a stage in the transformation
of revenge into criminal justice. Until this transformation
is complete, the remedy of punishment is more or less assimilated
to that of redress. Revenge is the right of the injured
person. The penalty of wrongdoing is a debt which the
offender owes to his victim, and when the punishment has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>been endured the debt is paid, the liability is extinguished,
innocence is substituted for guilt, and the <i><span lang="la">vinculum juris</span></i>
forged by crime is dissolved. The object of true redress is to
restore the position demanded by the rule of right, to substitute
justice for injustice, to compel the wrongdoer to restore
to the injured person that which is his own. A like purpose
is assigned to punishment, so long as it is imperfectly differentiated
from that retributive vengeance which is in some
sort a reparation for wrongdoing. The fact that in the expiatory
theory satisfaction is conceived as due rather to the
outraged majesty of the law, than to the victim of the
offence, merely marks a further stage in the refinement and
purification of the primitive conception.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 32. <b>Civil Justice; Primary and Sanctioning Rights.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We proceed now to the consideration of civil justice and
to the analysis of the various forms assumed by it. It consists,
as we have seen, in the enforcement of rights, as opposed
to the punishment of wrongs. The first distinction to be
noticed is that the right so enforced is either a Primary or a
Sanctioning right. A sanctioning right is one which arises
out of the violation of another right. All others are primary;
they are rights which have some other source than wrongs.
Thus my right not to be libelled or assaulted is primary; but
my right to obtain pecuniary compensation from one who
has libelled or assaulted me is sanctioning. My right to the
fulfilment of a contract made with me is primary; but my
right to damages for its breach is sanctioning.</p>

<p class='c006'>The administration of civil justice, therefore, falls into two
parts, according as the right enforced belongs to the one or
the other of these two classes. Sometimes it is impossible
for the law to enforce the primary right; sometimes it is
possible but not expedient. If by negligence I destroy
another man’s property, his right to this property is necessarily
extinct and no longer enforceable. The law, therefore,
gives him in substitution for it a new and sanctioning right
to receive from me the pecuniary value of the property that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>he has lost. If on the other hand I break a promise of
marriage, it is still possible, but it is certainly not expedient,
that the law should specifically enforce the right, and compel
me to enter into that marriage; and it enforces instead a
sanctioning right of pecuniary satisfaction. A sanctioning
right almost invariably consists of a claim to receive money
from the wrongdoer, and we shall here disregard any other
forms, as being quite exceptional.</p>

<p class='c006'>The enforcement of a primary right may be conveniently
termed specific enforcement. For the enforcement of a
sanctioning right there is no very suitable generic term, but
we may venture to call it sanctional enforcement.</p>

<p class='c006'>Examples of specific enforcement are proceedings whereby
a defendant is compelled to pay a debt, to perform a contract,
to restore land or chattels wrongfully taken or detained, to
refrain from committing or continuing a trespass or nuisance,
or to repay money received by mistake or obtained by fraud.
In all these cases the right enforced is the primary right
itself, not a substituted sanctioning right. What the law
does is to insist on the specific establishment or re-establishment
of the actual state of things required by the rule of
right, not of another state of things which may be regarded as
its equivalent or substitute.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sanctioning rights may be divided into two kinds by reference
to the purpose of the law in creating them. This purpose
is either (1) the imposition of a pecuniary penalty upon
the defendant for the wrong which he has committed, or
(2) the provision of pecuniary compensation for the plaintiff in
respect of the damage which he has suffered from the defendant’s
wrongdoing. Sanctioning rights, therefore, are either
(1) rights to exact and receive a pecuniary penalty, or
(2) rights to exact and receive damages or other pecuniary
compensation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first of these kinds is rare in modern English law,
though it was at one time of considerable importance both in
our own and in other legal systems. But it is sometimes the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>case even yet, that the law creates and enforces a sanctioning
right which has in it no element of compensation to the
person injured, but is appointed solely as a punishment for
the wrongdoer. For example, a statute may make provision
for a pecuniary penalty payable to a common informer, that
is to say, to any one who shall first sue the offender for it.
Such an action is called a penal action, as being brought for
the recovery of a penalty. But it is none the less a purely
civil, and in no respect a criminal proceeding. Primarily
and immediately, it is an action for the enforcement of a right,
not for the punishment of a wrong. It pertains, therefore,
to the civil administration of justice, no less than an ordinary
action for the recovery of a debt. The mere fact that the
sanctioning right thus enforced is created by the law for the
purpose of punishment does not bring the action within the
sphere of criminal justice. In order that a proceeding should
be criminal it is necessary that its direct and immediate
purpose should be punishment; it is not enough that its
purpose should be the enforcement of a right which has been
created by way of punishment. A proceeding is civil if
it is one for the enforcement of a right, and the source,
nature, and purpose of the right so enforced are
irrelevant.<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c016'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The second form of sanctioning right—the right to pecuniary
compensation or damages—is in modern law by far
the more important. It may be stated as a general rule, that
the violation of a private right gives rise, in him whose right
it is, to a sanctioning right to receive compensation for the
injury so done to him. Such compensation must itself be
divided into two kinds, which may be distinguished as Restitution
and Penal Redress. In respect of the person injured,
indeed, these two are the same in their nature and operation;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>but in respect of the wrongdoer they are very different. In
restitution the defendant is compelled to give up the pecuniary
value of some benefit which he has wrongfully obtained
at the expense of the plaintiff; as when he who has wrongfully
taken or detained another’s goods is made to pay him
the pecuniary value of them, or when he who has wrongfully
enriched himself at another’s expense is compelled to account
to him for all money so obtained.</p>

<p class='c006'>Penal redress, on the other hand, is a much more common
and important form of legal remedy than mere restitution.
The law is seldom content to deal with a wrongdoer by merely
compelling him to restore all benefits which he has derived
from his wrong; it commonly goes further, and compels him
to pay the amount of the plaintiff’s loss; and this may far
exceed the profit, if any, which he has himself received. It is
clear that compensation of this kind has a double aspect and
nature; from the point of view of the plaintiff it is compensation
and nothing more, but from that of the defendant it is
a penalty imposed upon him for his wrongdoing. The compensation
of the plaintiff is in such cases the instrument
which the law uses for the punishment of the defendant, and
because of this double aspect we call it penal redress. Thus
if I burn down my neighbour’s house by negligence, I must
pay him the value of it. The wrong is then undone with
respect to him, indeed, for he is put in as good a position as if
it had not been committed. Formerly he had a house, and
now he has the worth of it. But the wrong is not undone
with respect to me, for I am the poorer by the value of the
house, and to this extent I have been punished for my negligence.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 33. <b>A Table of Legal Remedies.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The result of the foregoing analysis of the various forms
assumed by the administration of justice, civil and criminal,

<h3 class='c017'>§ 34. <b>Penal and Remedial Proceedings.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>It will be noticed that in the foregoing Table legal proceedings
have been divided into five distinct classes, namely:
(1) actions for specific enforcement, (2) actions for restitution,
(3) actions for penal redress, (4) penal actions, and
(5) criminal prosecutions. It must now be observed that the
last three of these contain a common element which is absent
from the others, namely the idea of punishment. In all these
three forms of procedure the ultimate purpose of the law is
in whole or in part the punishment of the defendant. This
is equally so, whether he is imprisoned, or compelled to pay
a pecuniary penalty to a common informer, or is held liable
in damages to the person injured by him. All these proceedings,
therefore, may be classed together as <em>penal</em>, and as
the sources of <em>penal liability</em>. The other forms, namely
specific enforcement and restitution, contain no such penal
element; the idea of punishment is entirely foreign to them;
and they may be classed together as <em>remedial</em>, and as the
sources of <em>remedial liability</em>. From the point of view of legal
theory this distinction between penal and remedial liability
is, as we shall see, of even greater importance than that between
criminal and civil liability. It will be noted that all
criminal proceedings are at the same time penal, but that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>converse is not true, some civil proceedings being penal while
others are merely remedial.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be objected that this explanation fails to distinguish
between penal liability and criminal, inasmuch as punishment
is stated to be the essential element in each. The
answer to this objection is that we must distinguish between
the ulterior and the immediate purposes of the law. Proceedings
are classed as criminal or civil in respect of their immediate
aim; they are distinguished as penal or remedial in
respect of their entire purpose, remote as well as immediate.
One way of punishing a wrongdoer is to impose some new
obligation upon him, and to enforce the fulfilment of it. He
may be compelled to pay a penalty or damages. Whenever
this course is adopted, the immediate design of the law is the
enforcement of the right to the penalty or damages, but its
ulterior design is the punishment of the wrong out of which
this right arose. In respect of the former the proceedings
are civil, not criminal; while in respect of the latter they are
penal, not remedial. Penal proceedings, therefore, may be
defined as those in which the object of the law, immediate
or ulterior, is or includes the punishment of the defendant.
All others are remedial, the purpose of the law being nothing
more than the enforcement of the plaintiff’s right, and the
idea of punishment being irrelevant and inapplicable.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 35. <b>Secondary Functions of Courts of Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Hitherto we have confined our attention to the administration
of justice in the narrowest and most proper sense of the
term. In this sense it means, as we have seen, the application
by the state of the sanction of physical force to the rules
of justice. It is the forcible defence of rights and suppression
of wrongs. The administration of justice properly so called,
therefore, involves in every case two parties, the plaintiff and
the defendant, a right claimed or a wrong complained of by
the former as against the latter, a judgment in favour of the
one or the other, and execution of this judgment by the power
of the state if need be. We have now to notice that the
administration of justice in a wider sense includes all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>functions of courts of justice, whether they conform to the
foregoing type or not. It is to administer justice in the strict
sense that the tribunals of the state are established, and it
is by reference to this essential purpose that they must be
defined. But when once established, they are found to be
useful instruments, by virtue of their constitution, procedure,
authority, or special knowledge, for the fulfilment of other
more or less analogous functions. To these secondary and
non-essential activities of the courts, no less than to their
primary and essential functions, the term administration of
justice has been extended. They are miscellaneous and indeterminate
in character and number, and tend to increase
with the advancing complexity of modern civilisation.
They fall chiefly into four groups:</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) <em>Petitions of Right.</em>—The courts of law exercise, in the
first place, the function of adjudicating upon claims made by
subjects against the state itself. If a subject claims that a
debt is due to him from the Crown, or that the Crown has
broken a contract with him, or wrongfully detains his property,
he is at liberty to take proceedings by way of petition
of right in a court of law for the determination of his rights in
the matter. The petition is addressed to the Crown itself,
but is referred for consideration to the courts of justice, and
these courts will investigate the claim in due form of law, and
pronounce in favour of the petitioner or of the Crown, just as
in an action between two private persons. But this is not the
administration of justice properly so called, for the essential
element of coercive force is lacking. The state is the judge
in its own cause, and cannot exercise constraint against itself.
Nevertheless in the wider sense the administration of justice
includes the proceedings in a petition of right, no less than a
criminal prosecution or an action for debt or damages against
a private individual.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) <em>Declarations of Right.</em>—The second form of judicial
action which does not conform to the essential type is that
which results, not in any kind of coercive judgment, but
merely in a declaration of right. A litigant may claim the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>assistance of a court of law, not because his rights have been
violated, but because they are uncertain. What he desires
may be not any remedy against an adversary for the violation
of a right, but an authoritative declaration that the right
exists. Such a declaration may be the ground of subsequent
proceedings in which the right, having been violated, receives
enforcement, but in the meantime there is no enforcement nor
any claim to it. Examples of declaratory proceedings are
declarations of legitimacy, declarations of nullity of marriage,
advice to trustees or executors as to their legal powers and
duties, and the authoritative interpretation of wills.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) <em>Administrations.</em>—A third form of secondary judicial
action includes all those cases in which courts of justice
undertake the management and distribution of property.
Examples are the administration of a trust, the liquidation
of a company by the court, and the realisation and distribution
of an insolvent estate.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) <em>Titles of Right.</em>—The fourth and last form includes all
those cases in which judicial decrees are employed as the
means of creating, transferring, or extinguishing rights.
Instances are a decree of divorce or judicial separation, an
adjudication of bankruptcy, an order of discharge in bankruptcy,
a decree of foreclosure against a mortgagor, an order
appointing or removing trustees, a grant of letters of administration,
and vesting or charging orders. In all these cases
the judgment or decree operates not as the remedy of a
wrong, but as the title of a right.</p>

<p class='c007'>These secondary forms of judicial action are to be classed
under the head of the <em>civil</em> administration of justice. Here,
as in its other uses, the term civil is merely residuary; civil
justice is all that is not criminal.</p>

<p class='c019'>We have defined the law as consisting of the rules observed in the
administration of justice. We have now seen that the latter term is used
in a double sense, and the question therefore arises whether it is the strict
or the wide sense that is to be adopted in our definition of the law. There
can be no doubt, however, that logic admits, and convenience requires,
the adoption of the wider application. We must recognise as law the sum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>total of the rules that are applied by courts of justice in the exercise of
any of their functions, whether these are primary and essential or secondary
and accidental. The principles in accordance with which the courts determine
a petition of right, decree a divorce, or grant letters of administration,
are as truly legal principles as those which govern an action of debt or a
suit for specific performance.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='c013'>THE STATE.</span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c014'>§ 36. <b>The Nature and Essential Functions of the State.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>A complete analysis of the nature of law involves an inquiry
into the nature of the state, for it is in and through the state
alone that law exists. Jurisprudence is concerned, however,
only with the elements and first principles of this matter. An
exhaustive theory of political government pertains not to
jurisprudence, but to the allied science of politics. From the
lawyer nothing more is required than such an understanding
of the essential nature of the state, as is sufficient and necessary
for the establishment of sound juridical theory.</p>

<p class='c007'>A state or political society is an association of human beings
established for the attainment of certain ends by certain
means. It is the most important of all the various kinds of
society in which men unite, being indeed the necessary basis
and condition of peace, order, and civilisation. What then
is the essential difference between this and other forms of
association? In what does the state essentially differ from
such other societies as a church, a university, a joint-stock
company, or a trade union? The difference is clearly one of
<em>function</em>. The state must be defined by reference to such of
its activities and purposes as are essential and characteristic.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the modern state does many things, and different
things at different times and places. It is a common carrier
of letters and parcels, it builds ships, it owns and manages
railways, it conducts savings banks, it teaches children, and
feeds the poor. All these cannot be of its essence. It is
possible, however, to distinguish, among the multitudinous
operations of government, two which are set apart as primary
and essential. These two are <em>war</em> and the <em>administration of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>justice</em>. The fundamental purpose and end of political
society is defence against external enemies, and the maintenance
of peaceable and orderly relations within the community
itself. It would be easy to show by a long succession
of authorities that these two have always been recognised
as the essential duties of governments. The Israelites demanded
a king, that he “may judge us, and go out before us,
and fight our battles;”<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c016'><sup>[94]</sup></a> and this conception of the primary
end and aim of sovereignty obtains recognition still as true
and adequate. Leviathan, as Hobbes<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c016'><sup>[95]</sup></a> tells us, carries two
swords, the sword of war and that of justice. This is the
irreducible minimum of governmental action. Every society
which performs these two functions is a political society or
state, and none is such which does not perform them. How
much activity in other directions may be profitably combined
with them is a question with which we are not here concerned.
We are dealing with the definition, and therefore with the
essence, not with the accidents of political society.<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c016'><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is not difficult to show that war and the administration
of justice, however diverse in appearance, are merely two
different species of a single genus. The essential purpose of
each is the same, though the methods are different. Each
consists in the exercise of the organised physical force of the
community, and in each case this force is made use of to the
same end, namely, the maintenance of the just rights of the
community and its members. We have already seen that in
administering justice the state uses its physical power to enforce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>rights and to suppress and punish wrongs. Its purpose
in waging war—that is to say, <em>just</em> war, which is the only kind
which can be regarded as an essential form of state activity—is
the same. These two primary functions are simply the
two different ways in which a political society uses its power
in the defence of itself and its members against external and
internal enemies. They are the two methods in which a state
fulfils its appointed purpose of establishing right and justice
by physical force.</p>

<p class='c007'>What, then, is the essential difference between these two
functions? It lies apparently in this, that the administration
of justice is the <em>judicial</em>, while war is the <em>extrajudicial</em> use
of the force of the state in the maintenance of right. Force is
judicial, when it is applied by or through a tribunal, whose
business it is to judge or arbitrate between the parties who
are at issue. It is extrajudicial when it is applied by the
state directly, without the aid or intervention of any such
judge or arbitrator. Judicial force involves trial and adjudication,
as a condition precedent to its application; extrajudicial
force does not. Judicial force does not move to the
maintenance of rights or the suppression of wrongs, until
these rights and wrongs have been authoritatively declared
and ascertained by the formal judgment of a court. The primary
purpose of judicial force is to <em>execute judgment</em> against
those who will not voluntarily yield obedience to it. Only
indirectly, and through such judgment, does it enforce rights
and punish wrongs. But extrajudicial force strikes directly
at the offender. It recognises no trial or adjudication as
a condition of its exercise. It requires no authoritative
judicial declaration of the rights protected or of the wrongs
punished by it. When a rebellion or a riot is suppressed by
troops, this is the extrajudicial use of force; but when, after
its suppression, the rebels or rioters are tried, sentenced, and
punished by the criminal courts, the force so used is judicial.
To shoot a man on the field of battle or at a barricade is war;
to shoot him after capture and condemnation by a court
martial is the administration of justice.<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c016'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>In addition to the essential difference which we have just
noticed, there are several minor and unessential differences,
which are commonly, though not invariably present. The
chief of these are the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Judicial force is regulated by law, while the force of
arms is usually exempt from such control. Justice is according
to law; war is according to the good pleasure of those by
whom it is carried on. <i><span lang="la">Inter arma leges silent</span></i> is a maxim
which is substantially, though not wholly, true. The civil
law has little to say as to the exercise by the state of its
military functions. As between the state and its external
enemies, it is absolutely silent; and even as to the use of
extrajudicial force within the body politic itself, as in the
suppression of riots, insurrections, or forcible crimes, the law
lays down no principle save this, that such force is allowable
when, and only when, it is necessary. <i><span lang="la">Necessitas non habet
legem.</span></i> Within the community the law insists that all force
shall be judicial if possible. This protection against extrajudicial
force—this freedom from all constraint save that
which operates through the courts of law and justice—is
one of the chief privileges of the members of the body politic.
We accept it now as a matter of course, but in older and
more turbulent days it was recognised as a benefit to be
striven for and maintained with anxious vigilance.<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c016'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>2. In the second place judicial force is commonly exercised
against private persons, extrajudicial force against states. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>is clear, however, that this is not necessarily or invariably the
case. It is not impossible that one state should administer
justice between two others, or between another state and
itself. And on the other hand, it may wage war with its
own subjects, or with pirates or other persons who do not
constitute a political society.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Thirdly, the administration of justice is generally the
internal, while war is generally the external exercise of the
power of the state. In other words, the state commonly proceeds
against internal enemies by way of judicial, and against
external enemies by way of extrajudicial force. The administration
of justice is the right and privilege of the members of
the body politic itself. Those who stand outside the community—whether
they are individuals or states—have no
claim to the impartial arbitrament of judicial tribunals, and
may be struck at directly by the armed and heavy hand of
the state. Yet this also is merely a general, and not an
invariable rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Fourthly and lastly, in the administration of justice the
element of force is commonly latent or dormant, whereas in
war it is seen in actual exercise. Those persons against whom
the state administers justice are commonly so completely
within its power, that they have no choice save voluntary
submission and obedience. It is enough that the state
possesses irresistible force and threatens to use it; its actual
use is seldom called for. In war, on the other hand, there is
commonly no such overwhelming disparity of power, and a
state which in this fashion seeks to impose its will on others
must usually go beyond threats to their actual execution.
Hence it is, that in the administration of justice the element
of trial and adjudication is in appearance far more predominant
and important than that of force. Viewed externally
and superficially, this function of the state looks like the
elimination of force as a method of the settlement of controversies,
and the substitution of peaceful arbitration. But
it is not so. Force is the essence of the administration of
justice, no less than of war; but for the most part it lies
latent and concealed. The establishment of courts of justice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>marks not the substitution of arbitration for force, but the
substitution of one kind of force for another—of public force
for private, of judicial force for extrajudicial, of latent and
threatened force for that which is actually exercised. As
states increase in power, this difference between their two
essential functions is intensified. In feeble, turbulent, and
ill-governed states the element of force in the administration
of justice tends to come to the surface. The will of the state
no longer receives implicit obedience from those that are
subject to its jurisdiction. It may be necessary to execute
the judgments of the courts by military force, and there may
be little difference of external aspect between the use of
judicial force in the execution of a judgment, and the use of
extrajudicial force in the suppression of riot, rebellion, or
civil war.<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c016'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 37. <b>Secondary Functions of the State.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The secondary functions of the state may be divided into
two classes. The first consists of those which serve to secure
the efficient fulfilment of the primary functions, and the chief
of these are two in number, namely legislation and taxation.
Legislation is the formulation of the principles in accordance
with which the state intends to fulfil its function of administering
justice. Taxation is the instrument by which the state
obtains that revenue which is the essential condition of all
its activities. The remaining class of secondary functions
comprises all other forms of activity which are for any reason
deemed specially fit to be undertaken by the state. This
special fitness may proceed from various sources. It is
derived partly from the fact that the state represents the
whole population of an extensive territory; partly from the
fact that it possesses, through the organised physical force
at its command, powers of coercion which are non-existent
elsewhere; and partly from the fact that its financial resources
(due to the exercise of its coercive powers by way of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>taxation) are immensely beyond those of all other persons and
societies. Considerations such as these have, especially in
modern times, induced the state to assume a great number
of secondary and unessential functions which, in a peaceful
and law-abiding community, tend even to overshadow and
conceal from view those primary functions in which the
essential nature of the state is to be found.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 38. <b>The Territory of the State.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The territory of a state is that portion of the earth’s surface
which is in its exclusive possession and control. It is that
region throughout which the state makes its will permanently
supreme, and from which it permanently excludes all alien
interference. This exclusive possession of a defined territory
is a characteristic feature of all civilised and normal states.
It is found to be a necessary condition of the efficient exercise
of governmental functions. But we cannot say that it is
essential to the existence of a state. A state without a fixed
territory—a nomadic tribe for example—is perfectly possible.
A non-territorial society may be organised for the fulfilment
of the essential functions of government, and if so, it will be
a true state. Such a position of things is, however, so rare
and unimportant, that it is permissible to disregard it as
abnormal. It is with the territorial state that we are alone
concerned, and with reference to it we may accordingly define
a state as <em>a society of men established for the maintenance of
peace and justice within a determined territory by way of force</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 39. <b>The Membership of the State.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Who then are the members of this society, and by what title
do men obtain entrance into it? In all civilised communities
the title of state-membership is twofold, and the members
of the body politic are of two classes accordingly. These
two titles are citizenship and residence. The former is a
personal, the latter merely a territorial bond between the
state and the individual. The former is a title of permanent,
the latter one of temporary membership of the political community.
The state, therefore, consists, in the first place, of
all those who by virtue of this personal and permanent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>relationship are its citizens or subjects, and in the second
place, of all those who for the time being reside within its territory,
and so possess a temporary and territorial title to state-membership.
Both classes are equally members of the body
politic, so long as their title lasts; for both have claims to
the protection of the laws and government of the state, and
to such laws and government both alike owe obedience and
fidelity. They are alike subject to the dominion of the state,
and it is in the interests of both that the state exists and
fulfils its functions.</p>

<p class='c007'>These two titles of state-membership are to a great extent
united in the same persons. Most British subjects inhabit
British territory, and most inhabitants of that territory are
British subjects. Yet the coincidence is far from complete,
for many men belong to the state by one title only. They
are British subjects, but not resident within the dominions
of the Crown; or they are resident within those dominions,
but are not British subjects. In other words, they are either
non-resident subjects or resident aliens. Non-resident aliens,
on the other hand, possess no title of membership, and stand
altogether outside the body politic. They are not within the
power and jurisdiction of the state; they owe no obedience
to the laws, nor fidelity to the government; it is not for
them or in their interests that the state exists.<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c016'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>The practical importance of the distinction between the
two forms of state-membership lies chiefly in the superior
privileges possessed by citizens or subjects. Citizenship is a
title to rights which are not available for aliens. Citizens
are members <i><span lang="la">optimo jure</span></i>, while aliens stand on a lower level
in the scale of legal right. Thus British subjects alone possess
political as opposed to merely civil rights;<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c016'><sup>[101]</sup></a> until a few years
ago they alone were capable of inheriting or holding land in
England; to this day they alone can own a British ship or
any share in one; they alone are entitled when abroad to
the protection of their government against other states, or to
the protection of English courts of law against illegal acts of
the English executive; they alone can enter British territory
as of right; they alone are entitled to the benefit of certain
statutes from the operation of which aliens are expressly or
by implication excluded. It is true, indeed, that we must
set off against these special privileges certain corresponding
burdens and liabilities. Subjects alone remain within the
power and jurisdiction of the Crown, even when they are
outside its dominions. Wheresoever they are, they owe
fidelity and obedience to the laws and government of their
own state, while an alien may release himself at will from
all such ties of subjection. Nevertheless the status of a
subject is a privilege and not a disability, a benefit and not
a burden. Citizenship is the superior, residence the inferior
title of state-membership.</p>

<p class='c007'>Viewing the matter historically, we may say that citizenship
is a legal conception the importance of which is continuously
diminishing. The consistent tendency of legal
development is to minimise the peculiar rights and liabilities
of subjects, and to make residence rather than citizenship the
essential and sufficient title of state-membership. The acquisition
and loss of citizenship are being gradually made easier,
while the legal effects of its acquisition and loss are being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>gradually made less. The present state of things is, indeed,
a compromise between two fundamentally different ideas as
to the constitution of a political society. Citizenship and its
remaining privileges are the outcome of the primitive conception
of the state as a personal and permanent union of
determinate individuals, for whose exclusive benefit the laws
and government of the state exist. Residence, regarded as
a title of membership and protection, is the product of the
more modern conception of the state, as consisting merely of
the inhabitants for the time being of a certain territory. The
personal idea is gradually giving place to the territorial, and
the present twofold title of membership is the outcome of a
compromise between these two coexistent and competing
principles. It is not suggested, indeed, that the final issue
of legal development will be the total disappearance of personal
in favour of territorial membership. A compromise
between the two extreme principles, in some such form as
that which has now been attained to, may well prove permanent.
In the present condition of international relations
it is clearly necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have seen that citizens are those members of a state,
whose relation to it is personal and permanent, and who by
virtue of this relation receive from the state special rights,
powers, and privileges. If we ask further, what is the title
of citizenship, or how this special bond of union is constituted,
no general answer is possible. This is a matter of law,
varying in different systems, and from time to time in the
same system. English law claims as subjects all who are
born within the dominions of the Crown, regardless of their
descent; while French law, on the contrary, attaches French
citizenship to French blood and descent, regardless in general
of the place of birth.<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c016'><sup>[102]</sup></a> Viewed, however, in respect of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>historical origin and primitive form, we may say that citizenship
has its source in <em>nationality</em>. Fellow citizens are those
who belong not merely to the same state but also to the
same nation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is quite common to use the term citizenship and nationality
as synonymous, and this usage, though incorrect, is
significant of a very real connexion between the two ideas.
Nationality is membership of a nation; citizenship is one
kind of membership of a state. A nation is a society of men
united by common blood and descent, and by the various
subsidiary bonds incidental thereto, such as common speech,
religion, and manners. A state, on the other hand, is a
society of men united under one government. These two
forms of society are not necessarily coincident. A single
nation may be divided into several states, and conversely a
single state may comprise several nations or parts of nations.
The Hellenes were of one blood, but formed many states,
while the Roman empire included many nations, but was one
state. Nevertheless nations and states tend mutually to coincidence.
The ethnic and the political unity tend to coalesce.
In every nation there is an impulse, more or less powerful, to
develop into a state—to add to the subsisting community
of descent a corresponding community of government and
political existence. Conversely every state tends to become
a nation; that is to say, the unity of political organisation
eliminates in course of time the national diversities within
its borders, infusing throughout all its population a new and
common nationality, to the exclusion of all remembered
relationship with those beyond the limits of the state.</p>

<p class='c007'>The historical origin of the conception of citizenship is to
be found in the fact that the state has grown out of the
nation. Speaking generally we may say that the state is in
its origin the nation politically organised. It is the nation
incorporated for the purposes of government and self-defence.
The citizens are the members of a nation which has thus
developed into a state. Citizenship is nationality that has
become political. Men become united as fellow-citizens,
because they are, or are deemed to be, already united by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>bond of common kinship. It is for their benefit and protection
that the body politic has been established, and they are
its only members. Their citizenship is simply a legal and
artificial bond of union superimposed upon the pre-existing
bond of a common nationality. With aliens this national
state has no concern. It was not created on their behalf, and
they have no part or lot in it, for its law and government are
the exclusive birthright of its citizens. Only by slow degrees
does the notion of territorial membership arise and make
good its claim to legal recognition. Gradually the government
and the laws cease to be exclusively national and personal,
and become in part territorial also. The new principle
makes its way, that the state exists for the benefit and
protection of the whole population of a certain territory,
and not merely on behalf of a certain nationality. The law
becomes more and more that of a country, rather than that
of a people. State-membership becomes twofold, residence
standing side by side with citizenship. It becomes possible
to belong to the Roman state without being a Roman. The
citizens consent to share their rights with outsiders, but the
two classes never reach equality, and the personal union
stands permanently on a higher level than the territorial.
The special privileges retained by citizens at the present
day are the scanty relics of the once exclusive claims
of the nation to the protection and activities of the
state.<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c016'><sup>[103]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The relation between a state and its members is one of
reciprocal obligation. The state owes protection to its
members, while they in turn owe obedience and fidelity to it.
Men belong to a state in order that they may be defended
by it against each other and against external enemies. But
this defence is not a privilege to be had for nothing, and in
return for its protection the state exacts from its members
services and sacrifices to which outsiders are not constrained.
From its members it collects its revenue; from them it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>requires the performance of public duties; from them it
demands an habitual submission to its will, as the price of
the benefits of its guardianship. Its members, therefore,
are not merely in a special manner under the protection
of the state, but are also in a special manner under its
coercion.</p>

<p class='c007'>This special duty of assistance, fidelity, and obedience, is
called <em>allegiance</em>, and is of two kinds, corresponding to the two
classes of members from whom it is required. Subjects owe
<em>permanent</em> allegiance to the state, just as they are entitled to
its permanent protection. Resident aliens owe <em>temporary</em>
allegiance during the period of their residence, just as their
title to state protection is similarly limited. An alien, when
in England, must be faithful to the state, must submit to its
will, and obey its laws, even as an Englishman; but when
he leaves English shores, he leaves behind him his obligation
of allegiance, together with his title to protection. A British
subject, on the other hand, takes both of these things with
him on his travels. The hand of the state is still upon him
for good and evil. If he commits treason abroad he will
answer for it in England. The courts of justice will grant
him redress even against the agents of the Crown itself;
while the executive will see that no harm befalls him at the
hands of foreign governments.<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c016'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 40. <b>The Constitution of the State.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>In the definition of a state as a society with a special end
and function, there is implied a permanent and definite
organisation—a determinate and systematic form, structure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>and operation. A body politic is not constituted by a temporary
and casual union of individuals, for the purpose of
repelling an external enemy, or of executing judgment on
some domestic evildoer. The transition from natural to
political society is effected only when the union of individuals
has assumed a certain measure of permanence and
organisation, and when their combined operations in pursuit
of their common end have become in a certain degree systematic
and definite. It is only when a society has acquired
such an organisation, whether by way of agreement, custom,
forcible imposition, or otherwise, that it takes on the nature
of a body politic or state. It is only then, that there comes
into existence the <em>organ</em> which is essential to the performance
of those <em>functions</em> which constitute political government.</p>

<p class='c007'>The organisation of a modern state is of extraordinary
complexity, and it is usual to regard it as divisible into two
distinct parts. The first consists of its fundamental or
essential elements; the second consists of its secondary
elements—the details of state structure and state action.
The first, essential, and basal portion is known as the <em>constitution</em>
of the state. The second has no generic title.</p>

<p class='c007'>Constitutional law is, as its name implies, the body of those
legal rules which determine the constitution of the state. It
is not possible to draw any hard and fast line between the
constitution and the remaining portions of the state’s organisation;
neither, therefore, is it possible to draw any such line
between constitutional law and other branches of the legal
system. The distinction is one of degree, rather than one of
kind, and is drawn for purposes of practical convenience,
rather than in obedience to any logical requirement. The
more important, fundamental, and far-reaching any principle
or practice is, the more likely it is to be classed as constitutional.
Conversely, the more special, detailed, and limited in
its application, the less likely it is to find a place in any
exposition of the law and practice of the constitution. The
structure of the supreme legislature and the methods of its
action pertain to constitutional law; the structure and
operations of subordinate legislatures, such as those possessed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>by the colonies, are justly entitled to the same position;
but those of such subordinate legislatures as a borough council
would by general consent be treated as not sufficiently important
and fundamental to be deemed part of the constitution.
So the organisation and powers of the Supreme Court
of Judicature, treated in outline and not in detail, pertain
to constitutional law; while it is otherwise with courts of
inferior jurisdiction, and with the detailed structure and
practice of the Supreme Court itself.</p>

<p class='c019'>In some states, though not in England, the distinction between constitutional
law and the remaining portions of the legal system is accentuated
and made definite by the embodiment of the former in a special and
distinct enactment, the terms of which cannot be altered by the ordinary
forms of legislation. Such constitutions are said to be <em>rigid</em>, as opposed
to those which are <em>flexible</em>. That of the United States of America, for
example, is set forth in a document agreed upon by the founders of the
Commonwealth as containing all those principles of state structure and
action sufficiently important to be deemed fundamental and therefore
constitutional. The provisions of this document cannot be altered without
the consent of three-fourths of the legislatures of the different states.
The English constitution on the other hand is flexible; it is defined and
set apart in no distinct document, and is not distinguishable from the
residue of the law in respect of the methods of its alteration.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have defined constitutional law as the body of those
legal principles which determine the constitution of a state—which
determine, that is to say, the essential and fundamental
portions of the state’s organisation. We have here to face an
apparent difficulty and a possible objection. How, it may be
asked, can the constitution of a state be determined by law at
all? There can be no law unless there is already a state whose
law it is, and there can be no state without a constitution.
The state and its constitution are therefore necessarily prior
to the law. How then does the law determine the constitution?
Is constitutional law in reality law at all? Is not
the constitution a pure matter of <em>fact</em>, with which the law has
no concern? The answer is, that the constitution is both a
matter of fact and a matter of law. The constitution as it
exists <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> underlies of necessity the constitution as
it exists <i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i>. Constitutional law involves concurrent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>constitutional practice. It is merely the reflection, within
courts of law, of the external objective reality of the <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i>
organisation of the state. It is the theory of the constitution,
as received by courts of justice. It is the constitution,
not as it is in itself, but as it appears when looked at through
the eye of the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The constitution as a matter of fact is logically prior to the
constitution as a matter of law. In other words constitutional
practice is logically prior to constitutional law. There
may be a state and a constitution without any law, but there
can be no law without a state and a constitution. No constitution,
therefore, can have its source and basis in the law.
It has of necessity an extra-legal origin, for there can be no
talk of law, until some form of constitution has already obtained
<i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> establishment by way of actual usage and
operation. When it is once established, but not before, the
law can and will take notice of it. Constitutional facts will
be reflected with more or less accuracy in courts of justice as
constitutional law. The law will develop for itself a theory
of the constitution, as it develops a theory of most other things
which may come in question in the administration of justice.</p>

<p class='c007'>As an illustration of the proposition that every constitution
has an extra-legal origin, we may take the United States
of America. The original constituent states achieved their
independence by way of rebellion against the lawful authority
of the English Crown. Each of these communities thereupon
established a constitution for itself, by way of popular
consent expressed directly or through representatives. By
virtue of what legal power or authority was this done? Before
these constitutions were actually established, there was
no law in these colonies save that of England, and it was not
by the authority of this law, but in open and forcible defiance
of it, that these colonial communities set up new states and
new constitutions. Their origin was not merely extra-legal;
it was illegal. Yet so soon as these constitutions succeeded
in obtaining <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> establishment in the rebellious colonies,
they received recognition as legally valid from the courts of
those colonies. Constitutional law followed hard upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>heels of constitutional fact. Courts, legislatures, and law had
alike their origin in the constitution, therefore the constitution
could not derive its origin from them. So also with
every constitution that is altered by way of illegal revolution.
By what legal authority was the Bill of Rights passed, and
by what legal title did William III. assume the Crown? Yet
the Bill of Rights is now good law, and the successors of
King William have held the Crown by valid titles. <i><span lang="la">Quod
fieri non debet, factum valet.</span></i></p>

<p class='c007'>Constitutional law, therefore, is the judicial theory, reflection,
or image of the constitution <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i>, that is to say, of
constitutional practice. Here, as elsewhere, law and fact
may be more or less discordant. The constitution as seen by
the eye of the law may not agree in all points with the objective
reality. Much constitutional doctrine may be true in
law but not in fact, or true in fact but not in law. Power
may exist <i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i> but not <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i>, or <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> but not <i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i>.
In law, for example, the consent of the Crown is no less
necessary to legislation, than is that of the two houses of Parliament.
Yet in fact the Crown has no longer any power of
refusing its consent. Conversely, the whole system of cabinet
government, together with the control exercised by the
House of Commons over the executive, is as unknown in law
as it is well established in fact. Even in respect of the
boundaries of the state’s territories the law and the fact may
not agree. A rebellious province may have achieved its
<i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> independence, that is to say, it may have ceased to
be in the <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> possession and control of the state, long
before this fact receives <i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i> recognition.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nowhere is this discordance between the constitution in
fact and in law more serious and obvious than in England.
A statement of the strict legal theory of the British constitution
would differ curiously from a statement of the actual
facts. Similar discrepancies exist, however, in most other
states. A complete account of a constitution, therefore,
involves a statement of constitutional custom as well as of
constitutional law. It involves an account of the organised
state as it exists in practice and in fact, as well as of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>reflected image of this organisation as it appears in legal
theory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the constitution <i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i> and the constitution <i><span lang="la">de
facto</span></i> are not necessarily the same, they nevertheless tend
towards coincidence. Constitutional law and practice react
upon each other, each striving to assimilate the other to itself.
The objective facts of state organisation tend to mould
legal theory into conformity with themselves. They seek
expression and recognition through legislation, or through
the law-creating functions of the courts. Conversely, the
accepted legal theory endeavours to realise itself in the facts.
The law, although it necessarily involves a pre-existing constitution,
may nevertheless react upon and influence the constitution
from which it springs. It cannot create a constitution
<i><span lang="la">ex nihilo</span></i>, but it may modify to any extent one which
already exists. Constitutional practice may alter, while
constitutional law remains the same, and <i><span lang="la">vice versa</span></i>, but the
most familiar and effective way of altering the practice is to
alter the law. The will of the body politic, as expressed
through the legislature and the courts, will commonly realise
itself in constitutional fact no less than in constitutional
theory.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 41. <b>The Government of the State.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'><em>Political</em> or <em>civil power</em> is the power vested in any person
or body of persons of exercising any function of the state.
It is the capacity of evoking and directing the activities of
the body politic. It is the ability to make one’s will effective
in any department of governmental action. The aggregate
of all the persons or groups of persons who possess any share
of this civil power constitutes the <em>Government</em> of the state.
They are the agents through whom the state, as a corporate
unity, acts and moves and fulfils its end.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Legislative, judicial, and executive power.</em>—In respect of its
subject-matter, civil power is of three kinds, distinguished as
legislative, judicial, and executive; and the government is
similarly divisible into three great departments, namely, the
legislature, the judicature, and the executive. The functions
which pertain to the first and second of these departments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>have been already sufficiently explained. The executive is
simply the residue of the government, after deducting the
legislature and the judicature.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Sovereign and subordinate power.</em>—In respect of its extent
civil power, whether legislative, judicial, or executive, is of
two kinds, being either sovereign or subordinate. Sovereign
or supreme power is that which is absolute and uncontrolled
within its own sphere. Within its appointed limits, if any,
its exercise and effective operation are not dependent on or
subject to the power of any other person. An act of
sovereign power is one which cannot be prevented or annulled
by any other power recognised by the constitution of the
state. Subordinate power, on the other hand, is that which,
even in its own sphere of operation, is in some degree subject
to external control. There exists some other constitutional
power which is superior to it, and which can prevent, restrict,
or direct its exercise, or annul its operation.<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c016'><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 42. <b>Independent and Dependent States.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>States may be classified in two different ways: (1) with
respect to their external relations to other states and (2) with
respect to their internal composition. The former mode has
regard to their international, the latter to their constitutional
position and structure. Classified internationally or
externally, all states are of two kinds, being either <em>independent</em>
or <em>dependent</em>. Classified constitutionally or internally,
they are also of two kinds, being either <em>unitary</em> or <em>composite</em>.</p>

<p class='c006'>An independent or sovereign state is one which possesses
a separate existence, being complete in itself, and not merely
a part of a larger whole to whose government it is subject.
A dependent or non-sovereign state, on the other hand, is one
which is not thus complete and self-existent, but is merely a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>constituent portion of a greater state which includes both it
and others, and to whose government it is subject. The
British Empire, the United States of America, and the Kingdom
of Italy are independent states. But the Commonwealth
of Australia, the Dominion of Canada, and the States
of California and New York are dependent, for they are not
self-existent, but merely parts of the British Empire and of
the United States of America respectively, and subject to
their control and government.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is maintained by some writers that a dependent state is
not, properly speaking, a state at all—that the constituent
and dependent parts of an independent state may be termed
colonies, provinces, territories, and so on, but have no valid
claim to the name of state. This objection, however, seems
unfounded. It is contrary to the received usage of speech,
and that usage seems capable of logical justification. Whether
a part of a thing is entitled to the same name as the whole
depends on whether the whole and the part possess the same
essential nature. A part of a rope is itself a rope, if long
enough to serve the ordinary purposes of one; but part of
a shilling is not itself a shilling. Whether, therefore, any
territorial division of a state is to be classed as itself a state
depends on whether, in itself and in isolation, it possesses and
fulfils the essential functions of one. This in its turn depends
on the extent of the autonomy or independent activity which
is permitted to it by the constitution. Speaking generally,
we may say that any such division which possesses a separate
legislature, judicature, and executive, and is thus separately
organised for the maintenance of peace and justice, is entitled
to be regarded as itself a state. The Commonwealth of
Australia is a true state, though merely a part of the larger
state of the British Empire, for it conforms to the definition
of a state, as a society established and organised for the
administration of justice and for external defence. Were it to
become independent, it could, without altering its constitution,
or taking upon itself any further function than those
which it now possesses, stand alone as a distinct and self-sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>political community. But a municipal corporation
or a district council has not in itself the nature of a political
society, for it does not in itself fulfil the essential ends of one.</p>

<p class='c007'>International law takes account only of independent or
sovereign states, for it consists of the rules which regulate
the relations of such states to one another. A dependent
state is not an international unit, and possesses no international
personality. Internationally regarded, its existence
is simply a detail of the internal constitution of the larger
and independent state of which it forms a part. This internal
structure pertains exclusively to the constitutional law of
the state itself, and the law of nations is not concerned with
it. The existence of the Dominion of Canada or of the State
of Victoria is a constitutional, not an international fact, for
in the eye of the law of nations the whole British Empire is
a single undivided unit.<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c016'><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Independent states are themselves of two kinds, distinguished
as <em>fully sovereign</em> and <em>semi-sovereign</em>. A fully
sovereign state is, as its name imports, one whose sovereignty
is in no way derogated from by any control exercised over it
by another state. It is possessed of absolute and complete
autonomy. A semi-sovereign state, on the other hand, is
one which is to a greater or less extent subordinate to some
other, its sovereignty or autonomy being imperfect by reason
of external control. The authority so exercised over it is
termed a protectorate or sometimes suzerainty. Most independent
states are fully sovereign, the others being few in
number and anomalous in character. An example is Zanzibar,
which stands in this relation to the British Empire.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is carefully to be noticed that semi-sovereign states are
independent, in the sense already explained. They are self-existent,
international units, and not merely parts of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>state under whose control they are. Zanzibar is not part of
the British Empire. These are two distinct states, bearing
towards each other a relation which is international and
external, and not merely constitutional and internal. In
order that a state should be dependent or non-sovereign, it
is not enough that it should be under the control of another
state; it must also be a constituent part of the state under
whose control it is. The mere exercise of a partial dominion
by one state over another does not of necessity incorporate
the two into a higher unity. The establishment of a protectorate
is not equivalent to annexation. The acts of the
one state are not imputed to the other; the property and
territory of the one are not those of the other also; the
subjects of the one are not those of the other; one may be
at peace while the other is at war. The Ionian Islands
were formerly a protected state under the control of Great
Britain; but during the Crimean War they remained neutral
and at peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>A semi-sovereign state is in a position of unstable equilibrium.
It is the outcome of a compromise between dependence
and independence, which, save in exceptional circumstances,
is not likely to be permanent. The control exercised
by one independent state over another is in most cases
destined either to disappear altogether, so that the semi-sovereign
state becomes fully sovereign, or to develop until
the separate international existence of the inferior is merged
in that of the superior, the semi-sovereign state descending
to the lower level of dependency, and becoming merely a
constitutional subdivision of the state to which it is subordinate.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 43. <b>Unitary and Composite States.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Classified constitutionally, in respect of their internal
structure, instead of internationally, in respect of their
external relations, states are of two kinds, being either <em>unitary</em>
or <em>composite</em>. A unitary or simple state is one which is not
made up of territorial divisions which are states themselves.
A composite state on the other hand is one which is itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>an aggregate or group of constituent states. The British
Empire is composite, because many of its territorial divisions
are possessed of such autonomy as to be states themselves.
Some of these constituent states are also composite in their
turn, Australia and Canada, for example, being composed of
unitary states such as Queensland and Quebec.</p>

<p class='c007'>Composite states (whether dependent or independent) are
of two kinds, which may be distinguished as <em>imperial</em> and
<em>federal</em>. The difference is to be found in the nature of that
common government which is the essential bond of union
between the constituent states. In an imperial state the
government of one of the parts is at the same time the
common government of the whole. In a federal state, on the
contrary, the common government is not that of one of the
parts, but a central government in which all the constituent
states participate. The constitution of the British Empire
is imperial; that of the United States of America is federal.
In the former, one of the parts, namely, Great Britain and
Ireland, is preferred before the others, as supplying the
authority which binds all of them into a single whole. The
government of the United Kingdom possesses a double
capacity, local and imperial. In its local capacity it administers
the affairs of England, Scotland, and Ireland, just as
the government at Cape Town administers the affairs of Cape
Colony. But in another capacity it is the government of the
whole empire, and provides the bond of common authority
which unites all the constituent states of the empire into a
single body politic. In a federal, as contrasted with an imperial
constitution, there is no such predominance of one of
the constituent states. The government of the whole is one
in which all the parts have their allotted shares. The unity
of an imperial state is a relation of all the other parts to one
of them; the unity of a federal state is a relation of all the
parts to a central and common authority.<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c016'><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='c013'>THE SOURCES OF LAW.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 44. <b>Formal and Material Sources.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The expression source of law (<i><span lang="la">fons juris</span></i>) has several meanings
which it is necessary to distinguish clearly. We must distinguish
in the first place between the formal and the material
sources of the law. A formal source is that from which a rule
of law derives its force and validity. It is that from which
the authority of the law proceeds. The material sources, on
the other hand, are those from which is derived the matter,
not the validity of the law. The material source supplies
the substance of the rule to which the formal source gives the
force and nature of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The formal source of the whole body of the civil law is one
and the same, namely, the will and power of the state as
manifested in courts of justice. Whatever rules have the
sanction and authority of the body politic in the administration
of justice have thereby the force of law; and in such
force no other rules whatever have any share. The matter
of the law may be drawn from all kinds of material sources,
but for its legal validity it must look to the tribunals of the
state and to them alone. Customary law, for example, has
its material source in the usages of those who are subject to
it; but it has its formal source in the will of the state, no less
than statutory law itself.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 45. <b>Legal and Historical Sources.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Though the formal source of the law is one, its material
sources are many, and they are divisible into two classes
which may be distinguished as legal and historical. The
former are those sources which are recognised as such by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>law itself. The latter are those sources which are such in
fact, but are nevertheless destitute of legal recognition.
This is an important distinction which calls for careful consideration.
In respect of its material origin a rule of law is
often of long descent. The immediate source of it may be the
decision of an English court of justice. But that court may
have drawn the matter of its decision from the writings of
some lawyer, let us say the celebrated Frenchman, Pothier;
and Pothier in his turn may have taken it from the compilations
of the Emperor Justinian, who may have obtained it
from the praetorian edict. In such a case all these things—the
decision, the works of Pothier, the <i><span lang="la">corpus juris civilis</span></i>, and
the <i><span lang="la">edictum perpetuum</span></i>—are the successive material sources
of the rule of English law. But there is a difference between
them, for the precedent is the legal source of the rule, and the
others are merely its historical sources. The precedent is its
source not merely in fact, but in law also; the others are its
sources in fact, but obtain no legal recognition as such. Our
law knows well the nature and effect of precedents, but it
knows nothing of Pothier, or of Tribonian, or of the Urban
Praetor. The proposition that every principle embodied in a
judicial decision has for the future the force of law is not
merely a statement of historical fact as to the growth of
English law; it is itself a rule of law. But the proposition
that much of the law of Rome has become incorporated into
the law of England is simply a statement of fact, which has in
law no relevance or recognition.</p>

<p class='c007'>The legal sources of law are authoritative, the historical are
unauthoritative. The former are allowed by the law courts
as of right; the latter have no such claim; they influence
more or less extensively the course of legal development,
but they speak with no authority. No rule of law demands
their recognition. Thus both the statute-book and the
works of Jeremy Bentham are material sources of English
law. The historians of that system have to take account of
both of them. Much that is now established law has its
source in the ponderous volumes of the great law-reformer.
Yet there is an essential difference between the two cases.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>What the statute-book says becomes law forthwith and <i><span lang="la">ipso
jure</span></i>; but what Bentham says may or may not become law,
and if it does, it is by no claim of right but solely through the
unconstrained good pleasure of the legislature or the courts.
So the decisions of English courts are a legal and authoritative
source of English law, but those of American courts are in
England merely an historical and unauthoritative source.
They are treated with respect by English judges, and are in
fact the ground and origin of an appreciable portion of English
law, but their operation is persuasive merely, not authoritative,
and no rule of English law extends recognition to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The legal sources are the only gates through which new
principles can find entrance into the law. Historical sources
operate only mediately and indirectly. They are merely the
various precedent links in that chain of which the ultimate
link must be some legal source to which the rule of law is
directly attached.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are here concerned solely with the legal sources of the
law. Its formal source is involved in the definition of the
law itself, and has been already sufficiently dealt with. Its
historical sources pertain to legal history, not to legal theory.
Hereafter, when we speak of the sources of law, we shall
mean by that term the legal sources exclusively.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may help us to attain a clearer understanding of a
somewhat difficult matter if we attempt to reach a definition
of these sources from another standpoint. In every progressive
community the law undergoes a continuous process
of growth and change. This process of legal evolution does
not proceed by haphazard. It is not left to the discretion
of the judges to apply one law to-day and another to-morrow,
for the growth of the law is itself a matter governed by the
law. Every legal system contains certain rules determining
the establishment of new law and the disappearance of old.
That is to say, it contains certain rules to this effect: that all
new principles which conform to such and such requirements
are to be recognised as new principles of law, and applied
accordingly in substitution for, or as supplementary to the
old. Thus it is itself a principle of English law that any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>principle involved in a judicial decision has the force of law.
Similar legal recognition is extended to the law-producing
effect of statutes and immemorial customs. Rules such as
these establish the sources of the law. A source of law, then,
is any fact which in accordance with the law determines the
judicial recognition and acceptance of any new rule as having
the force of law. It is the legal cause of the admittance by
the judicature of any new principle as one which will be
observed for the future in the administration of justice.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 46. <b>A List of Legal Sources.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We cannot deduce from the nature of law the nature of its
sources, for these are merely contingent, not necessary; they
differ in different systems and even in the same system at
different periods of its growth. It is possible, however, to
distinguish five sources which in England or elsewhere have
possessed predominant influence. These are Legislation,
Custom, Precedent, Professional Opinion, and Agreement.
Legislation is the declaration or enunciation of a principle by
some adequate authority in the body politic; custom is the
realisation or embodiment of a principle in a uniformity of
practice; precedent is the judicial application of a principle
to its appropriate facts; professional or expert opinion is the
approval or recognition of a principle by the general voice of
those whose business it is to know the law; agreement is the
adoption of a principle by the consent of those whose interests
are affected by it. Such declaration, realisation, application,
approval, and adoption determine in each case the judicial
recognition as law of the principle so dealt with, and therefore
constitute the sources of the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>Law which has its source in legislation is called statute,
enacted, or written law. That which is based on custom is
customary law. Precedent produces case-law, and agreement
conventional law. That which is created by professional
or expert opinion has no recognised title, but in analogy
to German usage we may call it juristic law (<i><span lang="de">Juristenrecht</span></i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two chief reasons for allowing law-creative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>operation to these various sources. In the first place there
is a presumption that principles proceeding from them are
principles of truth and justice, worthy of adoption by the
judicature. A statute is an attempt made by the legislature
to formulate the rules of right for the use and direction of the
judicature. This attempt is not always successful, for law
and justice are sometimes far apart; yet no better device has
been discovered, and the courts accept the rules so formulated
as authoritative and final. A similar presumption of truth
and justice is one of the grounds of the operation of precedent
also. When one of the superior courts of law has, after
solemn argument and full consideration, laid down a certain
principle as one fit to be applied to the case in hand, there is a
reasonable presumption that this decision is correct, and that
the principle is a just one fit to be applied to all similar cases in
the future, that is to say, fit to receive permanent recognition
as a new rule of law. <i><span lang="la">Res judicata pro veritate accipitur.</span></i><a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c016'><sup>[108]</sup></a> So
also in the case of custom. Customary law has as one of its
foundations the presumption that whatever is customary is
just and expedient. The popular conscience embodies itself in
popular usage, and the law courts accept as authoritative the
principles so sanctioned and approved. Professional opinion—the
opinion of lawyers—is merely an historical, not a legal
source of English law. In other systems, however, and
chiefly in that of Rome, it has shown itself capable of serving
as one of the most important of legal sources. Almost all that
is of special value in Roman law has this as its origin; the
Digest of Justinian consists wholly of extracts from the writings
of Roman lawyers. It is clear that one of the grounds
for the allowance of such opinion as a source of law is to be
found in a reasonable confidence in the skill and knowledge
of the expert. <i><span lang="la">Cuique in sua arte credendum est.</span></i> Finally we
may see the same influence at work in the case of the fifth and
last source, namely agreement. Every man may be trusted
to see to his own interests and to claim his own rights. Whatever
rule, therefore, is freely agreed upon by two or more
persons as defining their mutual rights and obligations may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>confidently accepted by the law courts as a true and just rule
between those who have so consented to it. As to them, it
is fit and proper to be applied as law.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is, however, a second ground of not less importance
on which the efficacy of these legal sources rests. They are
not merely presumptive evidence of the justice and truth of
the principles proceeding from them, but they are the basis
of a rational expectation on the part of all persons concerned
that these principles will be consistently acted on in the
future. Justice demands that such expectations shall be
fulfilled. Even when a rule does not accurately conform to
the ideal standard, it may be a right and reasonable thing to
adhere to it, when it has once been formulated. For men act
on the faith of it; and to overturn an imperfect rule with all
the expectations built upon it will often do more harm than
can be counterbalanced by any benefits to be derived from
the substitution of a better principle. Thus legislation is an
announcement to all the world that in future certain principles
will be applied in the administration of justice. Forthwith
the expectations, dealings, and contracts of all men
concerned are based upon the principles so declared, and the
disregard of them by the judicature would be a breach of
faith and an ill service to the cause of justice. Similarly
the decision of a court may not be perfectly wise or just; but
whether it is or not, all men expect that like decisions will for
the future be given in like cases. It is often more important
that the course of judicial decision should be uniform and
within the limits of human foresight, than that it should be
ideally just. So with all the other sources of law. That
which has always been customary in the past is entitled for
this reason alone to a certain measure of allowance and
recognition in the future. That which is approved by the
general opinion of the legal profession serves so largely as the
basis of the actions and expectations of men, that the courts
of law will not lightly depart from it. That which all parties
interested have agreed to, and which they have declared as
valid law to bind them, may not, for all that, be absolutely
just and reasonable; but they must be held bound by it none
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>the less, otherwise there will be no certainty of dealing among
mankind.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 47. <b>The Sources of Law as Constitutive and Abrogative.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The process of legal evolution is threefold. It comprises
in the first place the increase or growth of law—that is to
say, the substitution of legal principles for the discretion of
courts, and the transformation of fact into law. It involves
in the second place the opposite process of the decrease of
law—the reconquest by the <i><span lang="la">arbitrium judicis</span></i> of domains
formerly occupied by legal principle—the transformation of
law into fact. Finally it includes the alteration of law—that
is to say, the destruction of one legal principle and the
substitution of another in its stead.</p>

<p class='c007'>To carry out this threefold process, it is clear that we
require instruments of legal development which are capable
not merely of creating new law, but of destroying old. It is
not sufficient to obtain new law which stands side by side with
the old, as a supplement to it; it is necessary to obtain new
law which excludes the old, as a substitute for it. We must
possess instruments of abrogative, and not merely instruments
of constitutive power. So far we have considered the
sources of law only in respect of this latter operation. We
have yet to consider to what extent they possess the power
of destroying law, as well as of creating it. The conservative
virtue of the law has at all times been very great. We find,
accordingly, that the constitutive operation of the sources is
much more general than the abrogative. It by no means
follows that, because a certain fact is capable of giving rise to
a new rule, it is equally capable of getting rid of an old one.
Legislation, indeed, is pre-eminent in this respect above all
other legal sources. Alone among the instruments of legal
development, it works with equal facility in both ways; and
it is this peculiarity which makes it so efficient a method of
legal reform.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the strict theory of the law, precedent is wholly constitutive,
being quite destitute of abrogative power. When the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>law is already settled, the judges have no authority save to
obey and administer it. Their power of making new law by
way of judicial decision is limited to those vacant spaces
where there is as yet no other law which they can apply.
Precedents make law, but cannot alter it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mercantile custom resembles precedent. So long as the
ground is vacant—so long as there is no rule of the common
law <i><span lang="la">in pari materia</span></i>—the proved custom of merchants will
be allowed by the courts as a source of new law. But so soon
as from this or any other source principles have been once
established in the matter, there is no longer any room for
new rules thus arising. Immemorial custom, on the other
hand, has full power to derogate from the common law,
though the statute law is beyond its operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Agreement possesses considerable, though not complete,
abrogative power. A great part of the law is subject to
supersession and modification by the consent of all persons
interested. <i><span lang="la">Modus et conventio vincunt legem.</span></i> It is law only
until and unless there is some agreement to the contrary.
The residue of the law, however, is peremptory, and not to
be thus excluded by consent. Agreements which attempt to
derogate from it, and to establish special law in place of it,
are illegal and void.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 48. <b>Sources of Law and Sources of Rights.</b></h3>

<p class='c021'>The sources of law may also serve as sources of rights. By a source
or title of rights is meant some fact which is legally constitutive of rights.
It is the <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> antecedent of a legal right just as a source of law is the
<i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> antecedent of a legal principle. An examination of any legal
system will show that to a large extent the same classes of facts which
operate as sources of law operate as sources of rights also. The two kinds
of sources form intersecting circles. Some facts create law but not rights;
some create rights but not law; some create both at once. An act of
Parliament for example is a typical source of law; but there are numerous
private acts which are clearly titles of legal rights. Such is an act of
divorce, or an act granting a pension for public services, or an act incorporating
a company. So in the case of precedent, the judicial decision is a
source of rights as between the parties to it, though a source of law as
regards the world at large. Regarded as creative of rights, it is called a
judgment; regarded as creative of law, it is called a precedent. So also
immemorial custom does upon occasion give rise to rights as well as to law.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>In respect of the former operation, it is specifically distinguished as prescription,
while as a source of law it retains the generic title of custom.
That an agreement operates as a source of rights is a fact too familiar to
require illustration. The proposition which really needs emphatic statement
in this case is that agreement is not exclusively a title of rights, but is
also operative as a source of law.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 49. <b>Ultimate Legal Principles.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>All rules of law have historical sources. As a matter of
fact and history they have their origin somewhere, though
we may not know what it is. But not all of them have legal
sources. Were this so, it would be necessary for the law to
proceed <i><span lang="la">ad infinitum</span></i> in tracing the descent of its principles.
It is requisite that the law should postulate one or more first
causes, whose operation is ultimate, and whose authority is
underived. In other words there must be found in every
legal system certain ultimate principles, from which all
others are derived, but which are themselves self-existent.
Before there can be any talk of legal sources, there must be
already in existence some law which establishes them and
gives them their authority. The rule that a man may not
ride a bicycle on the footpath may have its source in the
by-laws of a municipal council; the rule that these by-laws
have the force of law has its source in an act of Parliament.
But whence comes the rule that acts of Parliament have the
force of law? This is legally ultimate; its source is historical
only, not legal. The historians of the constitution know its
origin, but lawyers must accept it as self-existent. It is the
law because it is the law, and for no other reason that it is
possible for the law itself to take notice of. No statute can
confer this power upon Parliament, for this would be to
assume and act on the very power that is to be conferred. So
also the rule that judicial decisions have the force of law is
legally ultimate and underived. No statute lays it down.
It is certainly recognised by many precedents, but no precedent
can confer authority upon precedent. It must first
possess authority before it can confer it.</p>

<p class='c007'>If we inquire as to the number of these ultimate principles,
the answer is that a legal system is free to recognise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>any number of them, but is not bound to recognise more
than one. From any one ultimate legal source it is possible
for the whole law to be derived, but one such there must be.
A statute for example may at any time give statutory
authority to the operation of precedent,<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c016'><sup>[109]</sup></a> and so reduce it
from an ultimate to a derivative source of law.<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c016'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br> <span class='c013'>LEGISLATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 50. <b>The Nature of Legislation.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Legislation is that source of law which consists in the
declaration of legal rules by a competent authority. It is
such an enunciation or promulgation of principles as confers
upon them the force of law. It is such a declaration of
principles as constitutes a legal ground for their recognition
as law for the future by the tribunals of the state.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although this is the strict and most usual application of
the term legislation, there are two other occasional uses of it
which require to be distinguished. It is sometimes used in a
wide sense to include all methods of law-making. To legislate
is to make new law in any fashion. Any act done with
the intent and the effect of adding to or altering the law is, in
this wider sense, an act of legislative authority. As so used,
legislation includes all the sources of law, and not merely one
of them. “There can be no law,” says Austin,<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c016'><sup>[111]</sup></a> “without a
legislative act.” Thus when judges establish a new principle
by means of a judicial decision, they may be said to exercise
legislative, and not merely judicial power. Yet this is
clearly not legislation in the strict sense already defined.
The law-creative efficacy of precedent is to be found not in
the mere declaration of new principles but in the actual
application of them. Judges have in certain cases true legislative
power—as where they issue rules of court-but in
ordinary cases the judicial declaration of the law, unaccompanied
by the judicial application of it, has no legal authority
whatever. So the act of the parties to a contract, in laying
down rules of special law for themselves to the exclusion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>the common law, may be regarded as an exercise of legislative
power. But though they have made law, they have made it
by way of mutual agreement for themselves, not by way of
authoritative declaration for other persons.</p>

<p class='c007'>The writers who make use of the term in this wide sense
divide legislation into two kinds, which they distinguish as
<em>direct</em> and <em>indirect</em>. The former is legislation in the narrow
sense—the making of law by means of the declaration of it.
Indirect legislation, on the other hand, includes all other
modes in which the law is made.<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c016'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In a third sense legislation includes every expression of
the will of the legislature, whether directed to the making
of law or not. In this use, every act of Parliament is an
instance of legislation, irrespective altogether of its purpose
and effect. The judicature, as we have seen, does many
things which do not fall within the administration of justice
in its strict sense; yet in a wider use the term is extended
to include all the activities of the courts. So here, the legislature
does not confine its action to the making of law, yet
all its functions are included within the term legislation.
An act of Parliament may do no more than ratify a treaty
with a foreign state, or alter the calendar, or establish a
uniform time throughout the realm, or make some change
in the style and title of the reigning sovereign, or alter the
coinage, or appropriate public money, or declare war or
make peace, or grant a divorce, or annex or abandon territory.
All this is legislation in a wide sense, but it is not
that declaration of legal principles with which, as one of the
sources of law, we are here alone concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Law that has its source in legislation may be most accurately
termed <em>enacted</em> law, all other forms being distinguished
as <em>unenacted</em>. The more familiar term, however, is <em>statute law</em>
as opposed to the <em>common law</em>; but this, though sufficiently
correct for most purposes, is defective, inasmuch as the
word statute does not extend to all modes of legislation, but is
limited to acts of Parliament. Blackstone and other writers
use the expressions <em>written</em> and <em>unwritten</em> law to indicate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>distinction in question. Much law, however, is reduced to
writing, even in its inception, besides that which originates
in legislation. The terms are derived from the Romans,
who meant by <i><span lang="la">jus non scriptum</span></i> customary law, all other,
whether enacted or unenacted, being <i><span lang="la">jus scriptum</span></i>. We shall
see later, that according to the older theory, as we find it in
Blackstone and his predecessors, all English law proceeds
either from legislation or from custom. The common law
was customary, and therefore, adopting the Roman usage,
unwritten law. All the residue was enacted, and therefore
written law.<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c016'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 51. <b>Supreme and Subordinate Legislation.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Legislation is either <em>supreme</em> or <em>subordinate</em>. The former is
that which proceeds from the supreme or sovereign power in
the state, and which is therefore incapable of being repealed,
annulled, or controlled by any other legislative authority.
Subordinate legislation is that which proceeds from any
authority other than the sovereign power, and is therefore
dependent for its continued existence and validity on some
superior or supreme authority. The legislation of the Imperial
Parliament is supreme, for “what the parliament doth,
no authority upon earth can undo.”<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c016'><sup>[114]</sup></a> All other forms of
legislative activity recognised by the law of England are subordinate.
They may be regarded as having their origin in a
delegation of the power of Parliament to inferior authorities,
which in the exercise of their delegated functions remain
subject to the control of the sovereign legislature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief forms of subordinate legislation are five in
number.</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) <em>Colonial.</em>—The powers of self-government entrusted to
the colonies and other dependencies of the Crown are subject
to the control of the Imperial legislature. The Parliament
at Westminster may repeal, alter, or supersede any colonial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>enactment, and such enactments constitute, accordingly, the
first and most important species of subordinate legislation.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) <em>Executive</em>.—The essential function of the executive is
to conduct the administrative departments of the state, but
it combines with this certain subordinate legislative powers
which have been expressly delegated to it by Parliament, or
pertain to it by the common law. A statute, for example,
occasionally entrusts to some department of the executive
government the duty of supplementing the statutory provisions
by the issue of more detailed regulations bearing on the
same matter. So it is part of the prerogative of the Crown
at common law to make laws for the government of territories
acquired by conquest, and not yet possessed of representative
local legislatures.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) <em>Judicial</em>.—In the same way, certain delegated legislative
powers are possessed by the judicature. The superior
courts have the power of making rules for the regulation of
their own procedure. This is judicial legislation in the true
sense of the term, differing in this respect from the so-called
legislative action of the courts in creating new law by way of
precedent.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) <em>Municipal</em>.—Municipal authorities are entrusted by
the law with limited and subordinate powers of establishing
special law for the districts under their control. The enactments
so authorised are termed by-laws, and this form of
legislation may be distinguished as municipal.</p>

<p class='c007'>(5) <em>Autonomous</em>.—All the kinds of legislation which we
have hitherto considered proceed from the state itself, either
in its supreme or in one or other of its many subordinate
departments. But this is not necessarily the case, for legislation
is not a function that is essentially limited to the state.
The declaration of new principles amounts to legislation not
because it is the voice of the state, but because it is accepted
by the state as a sufficient legal ground for giving effect to
those new principles in its courts of justice. The <em>will</em> of the
state is, indeed, as we have already seen, the one and only
<em>formal</em> source of law; but it does not follow from this that
the <em>word</em> of the state is the sole form of that <em>material</em> source
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>of the law which is called legislation. In the allowance of
new law the state may hearken to other voices than its own.
In general, indeed, the power of legislation is far too important
to be committed to any person or body of persons save
the incorporate community itself. The great bulk of enacted
law is promulgated by the state in its own person. But in
exceptional cases it has been found possible and expedient to
entrust this power to private hands. The law gives to certain
groups of private individuals limited legislative authority
touching matters which concern themselves. A railway
company, for example, is able to make by-laws for the regulation
of its undertaking. A university may make statutes
binding upon its members. A registered company may alter
those articles of association by which its constitution and
management are determined. Legislation thus effected by
private persons, and the law so created, may be distinguished
as <em>autonomic</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a close resemblance between autonomic law and
conventional law, but there is also a real distinction between
them. The creation of each is a function entrusted by the
state to private persons. But conventional law is the product
of agreement, and therefore is law for none except those who
have consented to its creation. Autonomic law, on the contrary,
is the product of a true form of legislation, and is imposed
by superior authority <i><span lang="la">in invitos</span></i>. The act of a general
meeting of shareholders in altering the articles of association
is an act of autonomous legislation, because the majority has
the power of imposing its will in this respect upon a dissentient
minority. All the shareholders may in fact agree,
but the law-creating efficacy of their resolution is independent
of any such accidental unanimity. We may say, if we please,
that with respect to consenting shareholders the resolution is
an agreement, while with respect to dissentients it is an act
of legislative authority. The original articles of association,
on the other hand, as they stand when the company is first
formed, constitute a body of conventional, not autonomic law.
They are law for all shareholders by virtue of their own
agreement to become members of the company, and are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>the outcome of any subsequent exercise of legislative
authority vested in the majority.<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c016'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 52. <b>Relation of Legislation to other Sources.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>So great is the superiority of legislation over all other
methods of legal evolution, that the tendency of advancing
civilisation is to acknowledge its exclusive claim, and to discard
the other instruments as relics of the infancy of law.
The expressed will of the state tends to obtain recognition
not only as the sole formal source of law, but as its exclusive
material source also. Statute law has already become the
type or standard, from which the other forms are more or
less abnormal variations. Nothing is more natural than this
from our modern point of view, nothing less natural from that
of primitive jurisprudence. Early law is conceived as <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>
(the principles of justice), rather than as <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i> (the will of the
state). The function of the state in its earlier conception is
to <em>enforce</em> the law, not to <em>make</em> it. The rules so to be enforced
are those rules of right which are found realised in the immemorial
customs of the nation, or which are sanctioned by
religious faith and practice, or which have been divinely
revealed to men. It is well known that the earliest codes
were the work, not of mortal men, but of the gods.<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c016'><sup>[116]</sup></a> That
the material contents of the law depend upon the express or
tacit will of the state, that principles sanctioned by religion
or immemorial usage are laws only so long as the prince
chooses to retain them unaltered, that it is within the powders
and functions of political rulers to change and subvert the
laws at their own good pleasure, are beliefs which mark considerable
progress along the road of political and legal
development. Until such progress has been made, and until
the petrifying influence of the primitive alliance of law with
religion and immutable custom has been to some extent dissolved,
the part played by human legislation in the development
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>of the legal system is necessarily small, and may be
even non-existent. As it is the most powerful, so it is the
latest of the instruments of legal growth.</p>

<p class='c007'>In considering the advantages of legislation, it will be convenient
to contrast it specially with its most formidable rival,
namely precedent. So considered, the first virtue of legislation
lies in its abrogative power. It is not merely a source of
new law, but is equally effective in abolishing that which
already exists. But precedent possesses merely constitutive
efficacy; it is capable of producing very good law—better in
some respects than that which we obtain by way of legislation—but
its defect is that, except in a very imperfect and indirect
manner, its operation is irreversible. What it does, it
does once for all. It cannot go back upon its footsteps, and
do well what it has once done ill. Legislation, therefore, is
the indispensable instrument, not indeed of legal growth,
but of legal reform. As a destructive and reformative agent
it has no equivalent, and without it all law is as that of the
Medes and Persians.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second respect in which legislation is superior to precedent
is that it allows an advantageous division of labour,
which here, as elsewhere, results in increased efficiency. The
legislature becomes differentiated from the judicature, the
duty of the former being to make law, while that of the latter
is to interpret and apply it. Speaking generally, a legal
system will be best administered, when those who administer
it have this as their sole function. Precedent, on the contrary,
unites in the same hands the business of making the
law and that of enforcing it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true, however, that legislation does not necessarily
involve any such division of functions. It is not of the
essence of this form of legal development that it should
proceed from a distinct department of the state, whose
business it is to give laws to the judicature. It is perfectly
possible for the law to develop by a process of true legislation,
in the absence of any legislative organ other than the
courts of justice themselves. We have already noticed the
existence of this judicial legislation, in considering the various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>forms of subordinate legislative power. The most celebrated
instance of it is the case of the Roman praetor. In addition
to his purely judicial functions, he possessed the <i><span lang="la">jus edicendi</span></i>,
that is to say, legislative powers in respect of the matters
pertaining to his office. It was customary for each praetor
at the commencement of his term of office to publish an
<i><span lang="la">edictum</span></i> containing a declaration of the principles which he
intended to observe in the exercise of his judicial functions.
Each such edict was naturally identical in its main outlines
with that which preceded it, the alterations made in the
old law by each successive praetor being for the most part
accepted by his successors. By this exercise of legislative
power on the part of judicial officers, a very considerable
body of new law was in course of time established, distinguished
as the <i><span lang="la">jus praetorium</span></i> from the older <i><span lang="la">jus civile</span></i>.
Powers of judicial legislation, similar in kind, though less in
extent, are at the present day very generally conferred upon
the higher courts of justice. Yet though not theoretically
necessary, it is certainly expedient, that at least in its higher
forms the function of law-making should be vested in a
department of the state superior to and independent of the
judicature.</p>

<p class='c007'>A third advantage of statute law is that the formal declaration
of it is a condition precedent to its application in
courts of justice. Case-law, on the contrary, is created and
declared in the very act of applying and enforcing it. Legislation
satisfies the requirement of natural justice that laws
shall be known before they are enforced; but case-law
operates retrospectively, being created <i><span lang="la">pro re nata</span></i>, and
applied to facts which are prior in date to the law itself.<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c016'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Fourthly, legislation can by way of anticipation make rules
for cases that have not yet arisen, whereas precedent must
needs wait until the actual concrete instance comes before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>the courts for decision. Precedent is dependent on, legislation
independent of, the accidental course of litigation. So far as
precedent is concerned, a point of law must remain unsettled,
until by chance the very case arises. Legislation can fill up
a vacancy, or settle a doubt in the legal system, as soon as
the existence of this defect is called to the attention of the
legislature. Case-law, therefore, is essentially incomplete,
uncertain, and unsystematic; while if statute law shows the
same defects, it is only through the lethargy or incapacity
of the legislature. As a set-off against this demerit of precedent,
it is to be observed that a rule formulated by the
judicature in view of the actual case to which it is to be
applied is not unlikely to be of better workmanship, and
more carefully adapted to the ends to be served by it, than
one laid down <i><span lang="la">a priori</span></i> by the legislature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, statute law is greatly superior to case-law in point
of form. The product of legislation assumes the form of
abstract propositions, but that of precedent is merged in the
concrete details of the actual cases to which it owes its
origin. Statute law, therefore is brief, clear, easily accessible
and knowable, while case-law is buried from sight and knowledge
in the huge and daily growing mass of the records of
bygone litigation. Case-law is gold in the mine—a few grains
of the precious metal to the ton of useless matter—while
statute law is coin of the realm ready for immediate use.</p>

<p class='c007'>This very perfection of form, however, brings with it a
defect of substance from which case-law is free. Statute law
is embodied in an authoritative form of written words, and
this literary expression is an essential part of the law itself.
It is the duty of the courts to apply the letter of the law.
They are concerned with the spirit and reason of it only so
far as the spirit and reason have succeeded in finding expression
through the letter. Case-law, on the contrary, has no
letter. It has no authoritative verbal expression, and there
is no barrier between the courts of justice and the very spirit
and purpose of the law which they are called on to administer.
In interpreting and applying statute law, the courts are
concerned with words and their true meaning; in interpreting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>and applying case-law, they are dealing with ideas and
principles and their just and reasonable contents and operation.
Statute law is rigid, straitly bound within the limits
of authoritative formulae; case-law, with all its imperfections,
has at least this merit, that it remains in living contact with
the reason and justice of the matter, and draws from this
source a flexibility and a power of growth and adaptation
which are too much wanting in the <i><span lang="la">litera scripta</span></i> of enacted
law.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 53. <b>Codification.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The advantages of enacted law so greatly outweigh its
defects that there can be no doubt as to the ultimate issue
of its rivalry with the other forms of legal development and
expression. The whole tendency in modern times is towards
the process which, since the days of Bentham, has been
known as codification, that is to say, the reduction of the
whole <i><span lang="la">corpus juris</span></i>, so far as practicable, to the form of enacted
law. In this respect England lags far behind the Continent.
Since the middle of the eighteenth century the process has
been going on in European countries, and is now all but complete.
Nearly everywhere the old medley of civil, canon,
customary, and enacted law has given place to codes constructed
with more or less skill and success. Even in
England, and the other countries to which English law has
spread, tentative steps are being taken on the same road.
Certain isolated and well-developed portions of the common
law, such as the law of bills of exchange, of partnership, and
of sale, have been selected for transformation into statutory
form. The process is one of exceeding difficulty, owing to
the complexity and elaboration of English legal doctrine.
Many portions of the law are not yet ripe for it, and premature
codification is worse than none at all. But the final
result is not doubtful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Codification must not be understood to involve the
total abolition of precedent as a source of law. Case-law
will continue to grow, even when the codes are complete.
The old theory, now gradually disappearing, but still true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>in most departments of the law, is that the common law is
the basis and groundwork of the legal system, legislation being
nothing more than a special instrument for its occasional
modification or development. Unenacted law is the principal,
and enacted law is merely accessory. The activity of the
legislature is called for only on special occasions to do that
which lies beyond the constructive or remedial efficacy of the
common law. Codification means not the total disappearance
of case-law, but merely the reversal of this relation between
it and statute law. It means that the substance
and body of the law shall be enacted law, and that case-law
shall be incidental and supplementary only. In the most
carefully prepared of codes subtle ambiguities will come to
light, real or apparent inconsistencies will become manifest,
and omissions will reveal themselves. No legislative skill can
effectually anticipate the complexity and variety of the facts.
The function of precedent will be to supplement, to interpret,
to reconcile, and to develop the principles which the code
contains. Out of the code itself, therefore, a body of case-law
will grow, as a judicial commentary and supplement. It
will be expedient from time to time that this supplementary
and explanatory case-law be itself codified and incorporated
into successive editions of the code. But so often as this is
done, the process of interpretation will begin again with the
like results.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 54. <b>The Interpretation of Enacted Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We have seen that one of the characteristics of enacted
law is its embodiment in authoritative formulae. The very
words in which it is expressed—the <i><span lang="la">litera scripta</span></i>—constitute
a part of the law itself. Legal authority is possessed by the
letter, no less than by the spirit of the enactment. Other
forms of law (with the exception of written conventional law,
which in this respect stands by the side of statutory) have no
fixed and authoritative expression. There is in them no
letter of the law, to stand between the spirit of the law and
its judicial application. Hence it is that in the case of
enacted law a process of judicial <em>interpretation</em> or <em>construction</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>is necessary, which is not called for in respect of customary
or case-law. By interpretation or construction is meant the
process by which the courts seek to ascertain the meaning of
the legislature through the medium of the authoritative
forms in which it is expressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Interpretation is of two kinds, which Continental lawyers
distinguish as <em>grammatical</em> and <em>logical</em>. The former is that
which regards exclusively the verbal expression of the law.
It does not look beyond the <i><span lang="la">litera legis</span></i>. Logical interpretation,
on the other hand, is that which departs from the letter
of the law, and seeks elsewhere for some other and more
satisfactory evidence of the true intention of the legislature.
It is essential to determine with accuracy the relations which
subsist between these two methods. It is necessary to know
in what circumstances grammatical interpretation is alone
legitimate, and when on the contrary it is allowable to accept,
instead, the divergent results that may be attainable by way of
logical interpretation. In other words, we have to determine
the relative claims of the letter and the spirit of enacted law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The true principles on this matter seem to be the following.
The duty of the judicature is to discover and to act upon the
true intention of the legislature—the <i><span lang="la">mens</span></i> or <i><span lang="la">sententia legis</span></i>.
The essence of the law lies in its spirit, not in its letter, for
the letter is significant only as being the external manifestation
of the intention that underlies it. Nevertheless in all
ordinary cases the courts must be content to accept the <i><span lang="la">litera
legis</span></i> as the exclusive and conclusive evidence of the <i><span lang="la">sententia
legis</span></i>. They must in general take it absolutely for granted
that the legislature has said what it meant, and meant what
it has said. <i><span lang="la">Ita scriptum es</span></i> is the first principle of interpretation.
Judges are not at liberty to add to or take from or
modify the letter of the law, simply because they have reason
to believe that the true <i><span lang="la">sententia legis</span></i> is not completely or
correctly expressed by it. That is to say, in all ordinary cases
grammatical interpretation is the sole form allowable.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this general principle there are two exceptions. There
are two cases in which the <i><span lang="la">litera legis</span></i> need not be taken as
conclusive, and in which the <i><span lang="la">sententia legis</span></i> may be sought
from other indications. The first of these cases is that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>which the letter of the law is <em>logically defective</em>, that is to say,
when it fails to express some single, definite, coherent, and
complete idea.</p>

<p class='c007'>The logical defects by which the <i><span lang="la">litera legis</span></i> may be affected
are three in number. The first is ambiguity; for a statute,
instead of meaning one thing, may mean two or more different
things. In such case it is the right and duty of the
courts to go behind the letter of the law, and to ascertain
from other sources, as best they can, the true intention which
has thus failed to attain perfect expression.</p>

<p class='c007'>When a statutory provision is capable of two meanings,
it is commonly, though not invariably, the case that one of
these is more natural, obvious, and consonant with the ordinary
use of language than the other. The interpretation of
an ambiguous law is therefore of two kinds, according as it
accepts the more natural and obvious meaning, or rejects it
in favour of another which conforms better to the intention
of the legislature, though worse to the familiar usages of
speech. The former mode of interpretation is termed literal
or strict, and the latter may be distinguished as equitable.
The general principle is that interpretation must be literal,
unless there is some adequate reason to the contrary. In
the absence of sufficient indications that the legislature has
used words in some less natural and obvious sense, their
literal and ordinary signification will be attributed to them.
The maintenance of a just balance between the competing
claims of these two forms of interpretation is one of the
most important elements in the administration of statute law.
On each side there are dangers to be avoided. Undue
laxity, on the one hand, sacrifices the certainty and uniformity
of the law to the arbitrary discretion of the judges
who administer it; while undue strictness, on the other hand,
sacrifices the true intent of the legislature and the rational
development of the law to the tyranny of words. <i><span lang="la">Scire
leges</span></i>, said the Romans,<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c016'><sup>[118]</sup></a> <i><span lang="la">non hoc est verba earum tenere, sed
vim ac potestatem</span></i>.<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c016'><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>A second logical defect of statutory expression is inconsistency.
A law, instead of having more meanings than one,
may have none at all, the different parts of it being repugnant,
so as to destroy each other’s significance. In this case
it is the duty of the judicature to ascertain in some other
way the true <i><span lang="la">sententia legis</span></i>, and to correct the letter of the
law accordingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lastly, the law may be logically defective by reason of its
incompleteness. The text, though neither ambiguous nor
inconsistent, may contain some <em>lacuna</em> which prevents it from
expressing any logically complete idea. For example, where
there are two alternative cases, the law may make provision
for one of them, and remain silent as to the other. Such
omissions the courts may lawfully supply by way of logical
interpretation. It is to be noted, however, that the omission
must be such as to make the statute <em>logically</em> incomplete. It
is not enough that the legislature meant more than it said,
and failed to express its whole mind. If what it has said is
logically complete—giving expression to a single, intelligible,
and complete idea—the courts have no lawful concern with
anything else that the legislature may have meant but not
said. Their duty is to apply the letter of the law, therefore
they may alter or add to it so far as is necessary to make its
application possible, but they must do nothing more.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been already said that there are two cases in which
logical interpretation is entitled to supersede grammatical.
The first of these, namely that of some logical defect in the
<i><span lang="la">litera legis</span></i>, has been considered. The second is that in which
the text leads to a result so unreasonable that it is self-evident
that the legislature could not have meant what it
has said. For example, there may be some obvious clerical
error in the text, such as a reference to a section by the
wrong number, or the omission of a negative in some passage
in which it is clearly required.</p>

<p class='c007'>In considering the logical defects of the <i><span lang="la">litera legis</span></i>, we have
tacitly assumed that by going behind the defective text it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>always possible to discover a logically perfect <i><span lang="la">sententia legis</span></i>.
We have assumed that the whole duty of the courts is to
ascertain the true and perfect intention which has received
imperfect expression. This is not so, however. In a great
number of cases the defects of the <i><span lang="la">litera legis</span></i> are simply the
manifestation of corresponding defects in the <i><span lang="la">sententia</span></i>. If
the legislature speaks ambiguously, it is often because there
is no single and definite meaning to be expressed. If the
words of the legislature are self-contradictory, it is possibly
due to some repugnancy and confusion in the intention itself.
If the text contains omissions which make it logically imperfect,
the reason is more often that the case in question has
not occurred to the mind of the legislature, than that there
exists with respect to it a real intention which by inadvertence
has not been expressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>What, then, is the rule of interpretation in such cases?
May the courts correct and supplement the defective <i><span lang="la">sententia
legis</span></i>, as well as the defective <i><span lang="la">litera legis</span></i>? The answer is that
they may and must. If the letter of the law is logically defective,
it must be made logically perfect, and it makes no difference
in this respect whether the defect does or does not correspond
to one in the <i><span lang="la">sententia legis</span></i> itself. Where there is a
genuine and perfect intention lying behind the defective text,
the courts must ascertain and give effect to it; where there
is none, they must ascertain and give effect to the intention
which the legislature presumably would have had, if the
ambiguity, inconsistency, or omission had been called to
mind. This may be regarded as the <em>dormant</em> or <em>latent</em> intention
of the legislature, and it is this which must be sought
for as a substitute in the absence of any real and conscious
intention.<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c016'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of the <i><span lang="la">sententia</span></i>, as formerly in that of the <i><span lang="la">litera
legis</span></i>, it is to be noticed that the only defects which the courts
may remedy are <em>logical</em> defects. That the intention of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>legislature is ethically defective, is not a fact with which the
judicature has any concern. The <i><span lang="la">sententia legis</span></i> might have
been wiser, juster, or more expedient, had it been wider, or
narrower, or other than it actually is. But the courts have
no authority to detract from it, add to it, or alter it, on that
account. It may be that had a certain case been brought
to the notice of the legislature, the statute would have been
extended to cover it; but so long as it is logically complete
and workable without the inclusion of this case, it must stand
as it is. If a statute makes a provision as to sheep, which
in common sense ought to have been extended to goats also,
this is the affair of the legislature, not of the courts. To
correct the <i><span lang="la">sententia legis</span></i> on logical grounds is a true process
of interpretation; it fulfils the ultimate or dormant, if not
the immediate or conscious intention of the legislature. But
to correct it on ethical grounds is to assume and exercise
legislative power.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 55. <b>The Early Importance of Customary Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The importance of custom as a source of law continuously
diminishes as the legal system grows. As an instrument of
the development of English law in particular, it has now
almost ceased to operate, partly because it has to a large extent
been superseded by legislation and precedent, and partly
because of the very stringent limitations imposed upon its
law-creating efficacy, the legal requirements of a valid custom
being such as few customs can at the present day conform to.
In earlier times, however, it was otherwise. It was long the
received and official theory of English law that whatever was
not the product of legislation had its source in custom. Law
was either the written statute law, or the unwritten, common,
or customary law. Precedent was not conceived as being
itself a legal source at all, for it was held to operate only as
evidence of those customs from which the common law proceeded.
<i><span lang="la">Lex et consuetudo Angliae</span></i> was the familiar title of
our legal system. The common law of the realm and the
common custom of the realm were synonymous expressions.
It may be gravely doubted whether at any time this doctrine
expressed the truth of the matter, but it is clear that it was
much truer in the early days of our legal history, than it subsequently
became; and it remained the accepted theory long
after it had ceased to retain any semblance of the truth. For
some centuries past, the true sources of the great bulk of our
law have been statute and precedent, not statute and custom,
and the common law is essentially case-law, not customary
law. Yet we find Hale<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c016'><sup>[121]</sup></a> in the seventeenth century, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Blackstone in the eighteenth, laying down the older doctrine
as still valid. In the words of Blackstone:<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c016'><sup>[122]</sup></a> “The municipal
law of England&#160;... may with sufficient propriety be
divided into two kinds; the <i><span lang="la">lex non scripta</span></i>, the unwritten, or
common law; and the <i><span lang="la">lex scripta</span></i>, the written, or statute law.
The <i><span lang="la">lex non scripta</span></i>, or unwritten law, includes not only
general customs, or the common law properly so called; but
also the particular customs of certain parts of the kingdom;
and likewise those particular laws that are by custom observed
only in certain courts and jurisdictions.” Such language
is an echo of the past, not an accurate account of the
facts of the present day. Nevertheless even now custom has
not wholly lost its efficacy. It is still one of the legal sources
of the law of England, and an examination of its nature and
operation pertains to modern juridical theory, and not
merely to legal history or antiquities.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 56. <b>Reasons for the Reception of Customary Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The reasons for attributing to custom the force of law have
been already briefly indicated in relation to legal sources in
general. We have seen that, in the first place, custom is the
embodiment of those principles which have commended themselves
to the national conscience as principles of truth, justice
and public utility. The fact that any rule has already the
sanction of custom raises a presumption that it deserves to
obtain the sanction of law also. <i><span lang="la">Via trita via tuta.</span></i> Speaking
generally, it is well that the courts of justice, in seeking for
those principles of right which it is their duty to administer,
should be content to accept those which have already in their
favour the prestige and authority of long acceptance, rather
than attempt the more dangerous task of fashioning a set of
principles for themselves by the light of nature. The national
conscience may well be accepted by the courts as an authoritative
guide; and of this conscience national custom is the
external and visible sign.</p>

<p class='c007'>Custom is to society what law is to the state. Each is the
expression and realisation, to the measure of men’s insight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>and ability, of the principles of right and justice. The law
embodies those principles as they commend themselves to
the incorporate community in the exercise of its sovereign
power. Custom embodies them as acknowledged and
approved not by the power of the state, but by the public
opinion of the society at large. Nothing, therefore, is more
natural than that, when the state begins to evolve out of the
society, the law of the state should in respect of its material
contents be in great part modelled upon and coincident with
the customs of the society. When the state takes up its
function of administering justice, it accepts as true and valid
the rules of right already accepted by the society of which
it is itself a product, and it finds those principles already
realised in the customs of the realm. As those customs
develop and alter with change of circumstance and the
growth of public enlightenment, the state is wisely content to
allow such development and modification to reflect themselves
in the law which it administers. This influence of
custom upon law, however, is characteristic rather of the
beginnings of the legal system than of its mature growth.
When the state has grown to its full strength and stature, it
acquires more self-confidence, and seeks to conform national
usage to the law, rather than the law to national usage. Its
ambition is then to be the source not merely of the form, but
of the matter of the law also. But in earlier times it has perforce
to content itself with conferring the form and nature of
law upon the material contents supplied to it by custom.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second ground of the law-creative efficacy of custom is
to be found in the fact that the existence of an established
usage is the basis of a rational expectation of its continuance
in the future. Justice demands that, unless there is good
reason to the contrary, men’s rational expectations shall, so
far as possible, be fulfilled rather than frustrated. Even if
customs are not ideally just and reasonable, even if it can be
shown that the national conscience has gone astray in establishing
them, even if better rules might be formulated and
enforced by the wisdom of the judicature, it may yet be
wise to accept them as they are, rather than to overturn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>all those expectations which are based upon established
practice.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 57. <b>The Requisites of a Valid Custom.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>In order that a custom may be valid and operative as a
source of law, it must conform to certain requirements laid
down by law. The chief of these are the following:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>Reasonableness.</em>—A custom must be reasonable. <i><span lang="la">Malus
usus abolendus est.</span></i><a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c016'><sup>[123]</sup></a> The authority of usage is not absolute,
but conditional on a certain measure of conformity with
justice and public utility. It is not meant by this that the
courts are at liberty to disregard a custom whenever they are
not satisfied as to its absolute rectitude and wisdom, or
whenever they think that a better rule could be formulated in
the exercise of their own judgment. This would be to deprive
custom of all authority, either absolute or conditional.
The true rule is that a custom, in order to be deprived of legal
efficacy, must be so obviously and seriously repugnant to
right and reason, that to enforce it as law would do more
mischief than that which would result from the overturning
of the expectations and arrangements based on its presumed
continuance and legal validity. We shall see, when we come
to discuss the theory of precedent, how the authority of
judicial decisions is, in general, similarly conditional rather
than absolute; a precedent which is plainly and seriously
unreasonable may be overruled instead of followed. We are
told in the old books that a similar rule obtains in respect of
the authority of acts of Parliament themselves. It was once
held to be good law, that an unreasonable act of Parliament
was void.<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c016'><sup>[124]</sup></a> This, indeed, is no longer so; for the law-creating
authority of Parliament is absolute. Certain forms of subordinate
legislation, however, are still subject to the rule in
question; an unreasonable by-law, for example, is as void
and unauthoritative as an unreasonable custom or precedent.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>2. <i><span lang="la">Opinio necessitatis.</span></i>—The second requisite of a valid
custom is that which commentators on the civil law term
<i><span lang="la">opinio necessitatis</span></i>.<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c016'><sup>[125]</sup></a> By this is meant the conviction on the
part of those who use a custom that it is obligatory, and not
merely optional.<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c016'><sup>[126]</sup></a> Custom, merely as such, has no legal
authority at all; it is legally effective only because and in so
far as it is the expression of an underlying principle of right
approved by those who use it. When it is based on no such
ethical conviction or <i><span lang="la">opinio necessitatis</span></i>—when those who use
it hold themselves free to depart from it if they will—it is
of no legal significance. The only customs which are a
source of law are those which are observed by the community
as determining the rights and duties of its members.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>Conformity with statute law.</em>—The third condition of
legal validity is that a custom must not be contrary to an act
of Parliament. We shall see that certain forms of custom
possess not merely constitutive, but also limited abrogative
power, being capable of derogating from the old law, as well
as of creating new. But no custom of any sort is of any
validity as against statute law. The authority of legislation
is in English law higher than that of custom. By no length
of desuetude can a statute become invalid, and by no length
of contrary usage can its provisions be modified in the
smallest particular. The common law will yield to immemorial
usage, but the enacted law stands for ever.<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c016'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It must not be supposed that this rule is one of necessity,
derived by logical inference from the nature of things. It
is nothing more than a positive principle of the law of
England, and a very different rule was adopted by Roman
law,<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c016'><sup>[128]</sup></a> and by the various Continental systems derived from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>it. There the recognised maxim is <i><span lang="la">Lex posterior derogat priori.</span></i>
The later rule prevails over the earlier, regardless of their
respective origins. Legislation has no inherent superiority
in this respect over custom. If the enacted law comes first,
it can be repealed or modified by later custom; if the customary
law is the earlier, it can be similarly dealt with by
later enacted law. “If,” says Savigny,<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c016'><sup>[129]</sup></a> “we consider customs
and statutes with respect to their legal efficacy, we must
put them on the same level. Customary law may complete,
modify, or repeal a statute; it may create a new rule, and
substitute it for the statutory rule which it has abolished.”
So Windscheid:<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c016'><sup>[130]</sup></a> “The power of customary law is equal to
that of statutory law. It may, therefore, not merely supplement,
but also derogate from the existing law. And this is
true not merely of rules of customary law <i><span lang="la">inter se</span></i>, but also
of the relations of customary to statute law.”<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c016'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>Immemorial antiquity.</em>—The fourth requisite of the
validity of a custom relates to the length of time during
which it has been established. Here it is necessary to distinguish
between two kinds of customs, namely, those which
are <em>general</em>—the customs of the realm, prevailing throughout
the whole territory governed by the legal system—and those
which are <em>local</em>, being limited to some special part of the
realm.<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c016'><sup>[132]</sup></a> The rule of English law with respect to the necessary
duration of a custom is that one which is merely local
must have existed from <em>time immemorial</em>. In the case of
other customs, however, there is no such requirement. It
is there sufficient that the usage should be definitely established,
and its duration is immaterial. A local custom must
make up for the limited extent of its application by the long
duration of its existence, but other customs derive from their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>generality such a measure of authority as does not require
to be supplemented by length of days.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall see later, how the idea of immemorial custom was
derived by the law of England from the canon law, and by
the canon from the civil law. Time immemorial, or time
whereof the memory of man runs not, means in the civil and
canon law, and in the systems derived therefrom, and originally
meant in England also, time so remote that no living man
can remember it, or give evidence respecting it. Custom was
immemorial, when its origin was so ancient that the beginning
of it was beyond human memory, so that no testimony was
available as to a time when it did not as yet exist.<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a> In the
thirteenth century, however, a very singular change took
place in the meaning of the term. The limit of human
memory ceased to be a question of fact, and was determined
by a very unreasonable rule of law which still remains in force.
In consequence of the interpretation put by the judges upon
the Statute of Westminster I., passed in the year 1275, it
became an established legal principle that the time of memory
reached back as far as the commencement of the reign of
Richard I. and no further. From that day to this the law has
remained unaltered. The discordance between the memory
of man as it is in fact, and as it is in law, has been steadily
growing with the lapse of years, so that at the present day
the law of England imputes to living men a faculty of
remembrance extending back for seven centuries. There is
perhaps no more curious example of the conservatism of our
law.<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c016'><sup>[134]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>The rule, therefore, that a particular custom is invalid
unless immemorial means in practice this: that if he who
disputes its validity can prove its non-existence at any time
between the present day and the twelfth century, it will not
receive legal recognition. It is not necessary for the upholder
of it to prove affirmatively its existence during the whole of
that period. If he can prove that it has existed for a moderate
period, say twenty years, from the present day, this will raise
a presumption of its immemorial antiquity, which must be
rebutted by him who disputes it.<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c016'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is not difficult to understand the reason which induced
the law to impose this stringent limitation upon the efficacy
of local customs. It was designed in the interests of a uniform
system of common law for the whole realm. Had all
manner of usages been recognised without any such limitation,
as having the force of special law, the establishment and
maintenance of a system of common law would have been
rendered all but impossible. Customary laws and customary
rights, infinitely various and divergent, would have grown up
so luxuriantly, as to have choked that uniform system of law
and rights which it was the purpose of the royal courts of
justice to establish throughout the realm.<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c016'><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'><em>Origin of the rule as to time of memory.</em>—The requirement of immemorial
antiquity was introduced into the English law courts of the twelfth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>or thirteenth century from the canon law. In two respects the Canonists
developed and rendered more definite the somewhat vague and indeterminate
theory of customary law which we find in the writings of the Roman
lawyers. In the first place, clear recognition was accorded to the distinction
between <i><span lang="la">jus commune</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">consuetudines</span></i>, the former being the common,
general, or written law of the whole Church, while the latter consisted of the
divergent local and personal customs which were added to, or substituted
for the <i><span lang="la">jus commune</span></i> in particular places or in respect of particular persons.
This nomenclature, with the conceptions expressed by it, passed from the
canon law to the law of England.</p>

<p class='c019'>In the second place the Canonists attempted to supply a defect of the
civil law by laying down a fixed rule as to the necessary duration of customs.
They determined that no <i><span lang="la">consuetudo</span></i> was to be held valid, so as to derogate
from the <i><span lang="la">jus commune</span></i>, unless it was <i><span lang="la">praescripta</span></i>, that is to say, unless it had
endured during the legal period of prescription. Consuetudo praescripta
praejudicat juri communi.<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c016'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>What, then, was the period of prescription thus required? On this
point we find no agreement among the doctors, for there were several
different forms of prescription known to Roman law, and there was no
unanimity among the Canonists in the selection of any one of them as a test
of the validity of custom. Many favoured the adoption of the ordinary
decennial prescription of Roman land law, and held that a custom must
have endured for ten years at least, but need have lasted no longer.<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c016'><sup>[138]</sup></a> Others
demanded forty years, since this is the prescription required as against the
Church by the legislation of Justinian.<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c016'><sup>[139]</sup></a> At one time, however, there was a
widely held opinion that the true time of prescription required to enable a
custom to derogate from the common law of the Church was time immemorial.
Illa consuetudo praejudicat juri, cuius non exstat memoria
hominum.<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c016'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>This conception of time of memory as a period of prescription was
derived from the civil law. Immemorial prescription was there a mode of
acquiring servitudes. Ductus aquae cuius origo memoriam excessit, jure
constituti loco habetur.<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c016'><sup>[141]</sup></a> The Canon law adopted this rule, and made a
more extensive use of it. Immemorial prescription became a supplementary
mode of acquisition, available in all cases in which there was no
shorter period of prescription to which a claimant might have recourse.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>From the canon law it passed into the laws of France, Germany, and
England.<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c016'><sup>[142]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>As already stated, then, many Canonists recognised time immemorial
not merely as a period of prescription, but as a condition of the validity
of customary law. Suarez, writing at the end of the sixteenth century,
tells us, indeed, in the course of an exhaustive examination of the theory
of customary law, that in his day this doctrine was no longer received.<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c016'><sup>[143]</sup></a>
Long before Suarez, however, it had established for itself a secure place in
the law of England. The canonical principles of <i><span lang="la">consuetudo rationabilis et
praescripta</span></i> and of <i><span lang="la">tempus immemoriale</span></i> were in the thirteenth century at
the latest incorporated in our legal system by those ecclesiastical lawyers
who laid the foundations of it. This, indeed, was the only form of prescription
which obtained recognition from the common law. We find the rule
settled with perfect definiteness in the earliest Year Books of Edward I.<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c016'><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>5. <em>Conformity with the common law.</em>—The fifth and last
requirement of a valid custom is that, unless immemorial, it
must be consistent with the common law. That it must be
consistent with statute law is, as we have already seen, a rule
applicable to all customs whatever, whether immemorial or
not. That it must be consistent with the common law is a
rule applicable only to recent customs, and not to those which
have the prestige and authority of immemorial antiquity.
Modern custom possesses constitutive, but no abrogative
power; it must operate in the spaces left vacant by the law
already established; it may supplement the law, but cannot
derogate from it. Immemorial custom, on the other hand,
can destroy as well as create, so far as the common law is
concerned; though as against the statute law it is as powerless
as the most ephemeral usage.<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c016'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>The combined effect of the various rules which we have
considered is to render custom less and less important as a
source of new law. As the legal system develops, the sphere
within which custom is operative grows gradually smaller.
For, in the first place, custom cannot derogate from statute law,
and this latter tends progressively to absorb into itself
the whole of the common law. In the second place, the
requirement of immemorial antiquity precludes local custom
from operating as an instrument of fresh legal growth. Such
customs may now be proved and applied for the first time,
but they cannot now for the first time come into existence.
In the third place, all recent custom must be consistent with
the law as already established, whether common or statutory.
As the law develops and completes itself, therefore, there is
less and less room left for the constitutive operation of custom.
There are fewer vacancies within which customary law
may grow. It is for this reason that the growth of general
customary law has already all but ceased. Until a comparatively
recent date, a great part of mercantile law was so
imperfectly developed as to leave very considerable scope for
the operation of mercantile custom. The law as to negotiable
instruments, for example, was chiefly customary law.
But at the present day our mercantile law is so complete that
it is only in comparatively rare cases that the custom of
merchants has any opportunity of serving as the ground of
new principles.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 58. <b>Conventional Custom.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Custom which does not fulfil all the requirements hitherto
considered by us does not necessarily fail of all legal effect.
It cannot, indeed, operate as a source of law by virtue of its
own inherent authority. Yet it may nevertheless become
legally operative by being incorporated into agreements,
through the tacit consent of those who make them. Customs
so operative may be distinguished as <em>conventional</em>. It
is a rule of English law, as well as of other systems, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>where a contract is made in any matter in respect of which
an established custom exists, it must be interpreted by reference
to that custom, and the parties must be deemed to have
intended (in the absence of any expression of contrary intent)
to adopt it as one of the terms of their agreement. <i><span lang="la">In contractibus
tacite veniunt ea quae sunt moris et consuetudinis.</span></i><a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c016'><sup>[146]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>For example, if a lease of agricultural land is made in any
district in which there are established usages as to the mode
of agriculture and as to the relative rights and liabilities of
landlord and tenant, the parties must be taken to have agreed
to those usages as terms of the bargain, unless they have
expressly or implicitly shown an intention to the contrary.
In the same way, a mercantile contract must be taken to
incorporate any usages of trade which are relevant to its
subject-matter. In this manner customs which are not in
themselves authoritative as sources of law or rights may
become indirectly operative through the added authority of
agreement. But the law and rights so produced are in reality
conventional and not customary. It is sometimes not easy
to determine whether a custom is operative directly and as
such, or only indirectly as accessory to a contract, and the
distinction has not always been sufficiently adverted to.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 59. <b>Theories of Customary Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>So far we have been concerned rather with those positive
rules of English law which determine the validity and effect
of custom, than with the abstract theory of the matter. This
portion of juridical theory, however, has been the subject of
considerable discussion and difference of opinion, and it is
not free from apparent difficulties. We have to consider two
opinions which differ materially from that which is here
accepted as correct. The first of these is a characteristic
feature of foreign and more especially of German jurisprudence,
its reception being chiefly due to the influence of Puchta
and Savigny. It essentially consists in this, that custom is
rightly to be considered as a formal, and not merely as a
material source of law. According to this doctrine, custom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>does itself confer the force and validity of law upon the
principles embodied in it. It does not merely provide the
material contents which derive their validity as law from the
will of the state. It operates directly through its own inherent
force and authority; not indirectly by reason of its
recognition and allowance by the supreme authority and force
of the state. The will of the state is not admitted to be the
exclusive source of legal validity. It has no pre-eminence
in this respect above the will of the <em>people</em>, as manifested in
national usage. Custom is regarded as the expression of the
national will and conscience, and as such it confers immediately
the authority of law upon all principles approved by it.
The will of the state is simply a special form of the popular
will, and these are of equal authority. Customary law,
therefore, has an existence independent of the state. It will
be enforced by the state through its courts of justice because
it is already law; it is not because it will be so enforced,
that it is law.</p>

<p class='c019'>Thus it is said by Arndts,<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c016'><sup>[147]</sup></a> a German jurist of repute: “Customary law
contains the ground of its validity in itself. It is law by virtue of its own
nature, as an expression of the general consciousness of right, not by virtue
of the sanction, express or tacit, of any legislature.” So Windscheid:<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c016'><sup>[148]</sup></a>
“In custom is manifested the conviction of those who use it that such
custom is law (Recht), and this conviction is the source of the authority and
validity of customary law. For the ultimate source of all positive law is
national reason.... And this national reason can establish law in two
different ways, namely, mediately and immediately. Mediately, through
representation, it creates law by means of legislation. Immediately, it
creates law by means of custom.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding the credit of the great names by which
this theory is sanctioned, it is rightly and all but unanimously
rejected by English jurists. Custom is a material,
not a formal source of law. Its only function is to supply
the principles to which the will of the state gives legal force.
Law is law only because it is applied and enforced by the
state, and where there is no state there can be no law. The
popular conscience is in itself as powerless to establish or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>alter the law of the land, as it is to deal in like fashion with
the laws of nature. From custom, as from any other source,
the state may draw the material contents of the rules to
which it gives the form and nature of law, but from no other
source than the will of the state itself can this form or nature
be itself derived.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second theory of customary law is that which we may
term the Austinian, as having been advanced by Austin, and
generally received by his followers. Austin rightly repudiates
the German theory on the ground, already indicated, that
custom is not a formal but merely a material source of law.
The rejection of this and other allied confusions of thought is,
indeed, one of the great services which he and his school have
rendered to legal science. Nevertheless his own theory cannot
be regarded as wholly satisfactory. For he in his turn
confounds the legal and the historical sources of the law, and
erroneously regards custom as one of the latter, rather than
as one of the former. He considers that the true legal source
of customary law is to be found in the precedents in which
customs receive for the first time judicial recognition and
enforcement. Customary law is for him simply a variety of
case-law. It is case-law in which pre-existing customs have
served as the historical sources from which the courts have
drawn the matter of their decisions. The judges are conceived
as basing their judgments upon custom, just as, on
other occasions, they may base them on Justinian’s Digest
or on the law of nature. It follows from this that a custom
does not acquire the force of law until it has actually come
to the notice of the courts and received judicial approval
and application. If it is never disputed, and therefore never
requires enforcement, it never acquires the force of law at
all. “Law styled customary,” says Austin,<a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c016'><sup>[149]</sup></a> “is not to be
considered a distinct kind of law. It is nothing but judiciary
law, founded on an anterior custom.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This opinion, however, seems inconsistent with the established
doctrines of English law as to this matter. Custom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>is law not because it <em>has been</em> recognised by the courts, but
because it <em>will be</em> so recognised, in accordance with fixed rules
of law, if the occasion arises. Its legal validity is not
dependent on the accidents of litigation. A custom does not
wait to put on the nature of law until it has been actually
enforced by the courts, any more than an Act of Parliament
or an agreement is destitute of legal efficacy until it has
required and received judicial recognition. This recognition
may make a custom part of the <em>common</em> law, as being thereafter
entitled to judicial notice, but it was part of the <em>law</em>
already. The Austinian theory forgets that the operation
of custom is determined by fixed legal principles, just as
much as the operation of precedent itself. These two are
co-ordinate legal sources, and each operates independently of
the other. Custom does not enter the law through precedent,
any more than precedent through custom. A custom
is taken as the ground of a judicial decision, just as an Act
of Parliament is so taken. In each case the law has been
already made, and the judicial decision merely applies it.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 60. <b>Custom and Prescription.</b></h3>

<p class='c021'>The relation between custom and prescription is such as to demand
attention here, although the theory of the latter will receive further
consideration in another place. Custom is long usage operating as a
source of law; prescription is long usage operating as a source of rights.
That all the lands in a certain borough have from time immemorial, on the
death of an owner intestate, descended to his youngest son, is a custom,
and is the source of a rule of special and customary law excluding in that
borough the common law of primogeniture. But that John Styles, the
owner of a certain farm, and all his predecessors in title, from time immemorial
have used a way over the adjoining farm is a prescription, and is the
source of a prescriptive right of way vested in John Styles.</p>

<p class='c019'>Regarded historically, the law of prescription is merely a branch of the
law of custom. A prescription was originally conceived as a <em>personal</em>
custom, that is to say, a custom limited to a particular person and his
ancestors or predecessors in title. It was distinguished from a local custom,
which was limited to an individual place, not to an individual person.
Local and personal customs were classed as the two species of <em>particular
customs</em>, and as together opposed to the general customs of the realm.
Coke distinguishes as follows between custom (<em>i.e.</em> local custom) and prescription.<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c016'><sup>[150]</sup></a>
“In the common law, a prescription which is personal is for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>the most part applied to persons, being made in the name of a certain
person and of his ancestors, or those whose estate he hath; or in bodies
politique or corporate and their predecessors.... And a custome, which
is local, is alleged in no person, but layd within some mannor or other place.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Since prescription and custom were thus regarded as two species of
the same thing, we find, as might be expected, that they are originally
governed by essentially similar rules of law. The requisites of a valid
prescription were in essence the same as those of a valid custom. Both
must be reasonable, both must be immemorial, both must be consistent
with statute law, and so on. It was only by a process of gradual differentiation,
and by the later recognition of other forms of prescription not known
to the early law, that the difference between the creation of customary law
and the creation of prescriptive rights has been brought clearly into view.
In the case of custom, for example, the old rule as to time immemorial
still subsists, but in the case of prescription it has been superseded by the
statutory rules contained in that most unfortunate specimen of legislative
skill, the Prescription Act. A prescriptive right to light, for instance, is
now finally acquired by enjoyment for twenty years. Usage during this
period is now an absolute title, instead of, as at common law, merely
evidence of usage during time of memory.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 61. <b>The Authority of Precedents.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The importance of judicial precedents has always been a
distinguishing characteristic of English law. The great body
of the common or unwritten law is almost entirely the product
of decided cases, accumulated in an immense series of
reports extending backwards with scarcely a break to the
reign of Edward the First at the close of the thirteenth
century. Orthodox legal theory, indeed, long professed to
regard the common law as customary law, and judicial decisions
as merely evidence of custom and of the law derived
therefrom. This, however, was never much better than an
admitted fiction. In practice, if not in theory, the common
law in England has been created by the decisions of English
judges. Neither Roman law, however, nor any of those
modern systems which are founded upon it, allows any such
place or authority to precedent. They allow to it no further
or other influence than that which is possessed by any other
expression of expert legal opinion. A book of reports and a
text-book are on the same level. They are both evidences
of the law; they are both instruments for the persuasion of
judges; but neither of them is anything more.<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c016'><sup>[151]</sup></a> English law,
on the other hand, draws a sharp distinction between them.
A judicial precedent speaks in England with authority; it is
not merely evidence of the law but a source of it; and the
courts are bound to follow the law that is so established.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems clear that we must attribute this feature of English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>law to the peculiarly powerful and authoritative position
which has been at all times occupied by English judges.
From the earliest times the judges of the king’s courts have
been a small and compact body of legal experts. They have
worked together in harmony, imposing their own views of law
and justice upon the whole realm, and establishing thereby a
single homogeneous system of common law. Of this system
they were the creators and authoritative interpreters, and
they did their work with little interference either from local
custom or from legislation. The centralization and concentration
of the administration of justice in the royal courts
gave to the royal judges a power and prestige which would
have been unattainable on any other system. The authority
of precedents was great in England because of the power, the
skill, and the professional reputation of the judges who made
them. In England the bench has always given law to the
bar; in Rome it was the other way about, for in Rome there
was no permanent body of professional judges capable of
doing the work that has been done for centuries in England
by the royal courts.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 62. <b>Declaratory and Original Precedents.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>In proceeding to consider the various kinds of precedents
and the methods of their operation, we have in the first place
to distinguish between those decisions which are creative of
the law and those which are merely declaratory of it. A
<em>declaratory</em> precedent is one which is merely the application
of an already existing rule of law; an <em>original</em> precedent is
one which creates and applies a new rule. In the former
case the rule is applied because it is already law; in the latter
case it is law for the future because it is now applied. In
any well-developed system such as that of modern England,
declaratory precedents are far more numerous than those of
the other class; for on most points the law is already settled,
and judicial decisions are therefore commonly mere declarations
of pre-existing principles. Original precedents, however,
though fewer in number, are greater in importance.
For they alone develop the law; the others leave it as it was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>and their only use is to serve as good evidence of it for the
future. Unless required for this purpose, a merely declaratory
decision is not perpetuated as an authority in the law
reports. When the law is already sufficiently well evidenced,
as when it is embodied in a statute or set forth with fulness
and clearness in some comparatively modern case, the reporting
of declaratory decisions is merely a needless addition to
the great bulk of our case-law.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be understood, however, that a declaratory precedent
is just as truly a source of law as is one belonging to
the other class. The legal authority of each is exactly the
same. Speaking generally, the authority and legal validity
of a precedent do not depend on whether it is, or is not, an
accurate statement of previously existing law. Whether it is
or is not, it may establish as law for the future that which it
now declares and applies as law. The distinction between
the two kinds turns solely on their relation to the law of the
past, and not at all on their relation to that of the future. A
declaratory precedent, like a declaratory statute, is a source
of law, though it is not a source of <em>new</em> law. Here, as elsewhere,
the mere fact that two sources overlap, and that the
same legal principle is established by both of them, does not
deprive either of them of its true nature as a legal source. Each
remains an independent and self-sufficient basis of the rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already referred to the old theory that the common
law is customary, not case-law. This doctrine may be
expressed by saying that according to it all precedents are
declaratory merely, and that their original operation is not
recognised by the law of England. Thus Hale says in his
<cite>History of the Common Law</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“It is true the decisions of courts of justice, though by virtue of the laws
of this realm they do bind as a law between the parties thereto, as to
the particular case in question, till reversed by error or attaint, yet they
do not make a law properly so called: for that only the king and parliament
can do; yet they have a great weight and authority in expounding,
declaring, and publishing what the law of this kingdom is; especially
when such decisions hold a consonancy and congruity with resolutions and
decisions of former times.”<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c016'><sup>[152]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Hale, however, is evidently troubled in mind as to the true
position of precedent, and as to the sufficiency of the declaratory
theory thus set forth by him, for elsewhere he tells
us inconsistently that there are three sources of English law,
namely, (1) custom, (2) the authority of Parliament, and
(3) “the judicial decisions of courts of justice consonant to
one another in the series and succession of time.”<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c016'><sup>[153]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the Court of Chancery this declaratory theory never
prevailed, nor indeed could it, having regard to the known
history of the system of equity administered by that court.
There could be no pretence that the principles of equity were
founded either in custom or legislation, for it was a perfectly
obvious fact that they had their origin in judicial decisions.
The judgments of each Chancellor made law for himself
and his successors.</p>

<p class='c019'>“It must not be forgotten,” says Sir George Jessel, “that the rules of
courts of equity are not, like the rules of the common law, supposed to have
been established from time immemorial. It is perfectly well known that
they have been established from time to time—altered, improved, and
refined from time to time. In many cases we know the names of the
Chancellors who invented them. No doubt they were invented for the
purpose of securing the better administration of justice, but still they were
invented.”<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c016'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Both at law and in equity, however, the declaratory theory
must be totally rejected if we are to attain to any sound
analysis and explanation of the true operation of judicial
decisions. We must admit openly that precedents make law
as well as declare it. We must admit further that this effect
is not merely accidental and indirect, the result of judicial
error in the interpretation and authoritative declaration of
the law. Doubtless judges have many times altered the law
while endeavouring in good faith to declare it. But we must
recognise a distinct law-creating power vested in them and
openly and lawfully exercised. Original precedents are the
outcome of the intentional exercise by the courts of their
privilege of developing the law at the same time that they
administer it.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ 63. <b>Authoritative and Persuasive Precedents.</b></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Decisions are further divisible into two classes, which may
be distinguished as authoritative and persuasive. These two
differ in respect of the kind of influence which they exercise
upon the future course of the administration of justice. An
authoritative precedent is one which judges must follow
whether they approve of it or not. It is binding upon them
and excludes their judicial discretion for the future. A
persuasive precedent is one which the judges are under no
obligation to follow, but which they will take into consideration,
and to which they will attach such weight as it seems
to them to deserve. It depends for its influence upon its
own merits, not upon any legal claim which it has to recognition.
In other words, authoritative precedents are <em>legal</em>
sources of law, while persuasive precedents are merely <em>historical</em>.
The former establish law in pursuance of a definite
rule of law which confers upon them that effect, while the
latter, if they succeed in establishing law at all, do so indirectly,
through serving as the historical ground of some later
authoritative precedent. In themselves they have no legal
force or effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The authoritative precedents recognised by English law
are the decisions of the superior courts of justice in England.
The chief classes of persuasive precedents are the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) Foreign judgments, and more especially those of
American courts.<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c016'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(2) The decisions of superior courts in other portions of
the British Empire, for example, the Irish courts.<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c016'><sup>[156]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(3) The judgments of the Privy Council when sitting as
the final court of appeal from the Colonies.<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c016'><sup>[157]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(4) Judicial <i><span lang="la">dicta</span></i>, that is to say, statements of law which
go beyond the occasion, and lay down a rule that is irrelevant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>or unnecessary for the purpose in hand. We shall see later
that the authoritative influence of precedents does not extend
to such <i><span lang="la">obiter dicta</span></i>, but they are not equally destitute of
persuasive efficacy.<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c016'><sup>[158]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 64. <b>The Absolute and Conditional Authority of Precedents.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Authoritative precedents are of two kinds, for their authority
is either absolute or conditional. In the former case
the decision is absolutely binding and must be followed
without question, however unreasonable or erroneous it may
be considered to be. It has a legal claim to implicit and
unquestioning obedience. Where, on the other hand, a precedent
possesses merely conditional authority, the courts
possess a certain limited power of disregarding it. In all
ordinary cases it is binding, but there is one special case in
which its authority may be lawfully denied. It may be overruled
or dissented from, when it is not merely wrong, but so
clearly and seriously wrong that its reversal is demanded in
the interests of the sound administration of justice. Otherwise
it must be followed, even though the court which follows
it is persuaded that it is erroneous or unreasonable.
The full significance of this rule will require further consideration
shortly. In the meantime it is necessary to state
what classes of decisions are recognised by English law as
absolutely, and what as merely conditionally authoritative.</p>

<p class='c006'>Absolute authority exists in the following cases:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) Every court is absolutely bound by the decisions of all
courts superior to itself. A court of first instance cannot
question a decision of the Court of Appeal, nor can the Court
of Appeal refuse to follow the judgments of the House of
Lords.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) The House of Lords is absolutely bound by its own
decisions. “A decision of this House once given upon a point
of law is conclusive upon this House afterwards, and it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>impossible to raise that question again as if it was <i><span lang="la">res integra</span></i>
and could be re-argued, and so the House be asked to reverse
its own decision.”<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c016'><sup>[159]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(3) The Court of Appeal is, it would seem, absolutely
bound by its own decisions and by those of older courts of
co-ordinate authority, for example, the Court of Exchequer
Chamber.<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c016'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In all other cases save these three, it would seem that the
authority of precedents is merely conditional. It is to be
noticed, however, that the force of a decision depends not
merely on the court by which it is given but also on the
court in which it is cited. Its authority may be absolute in
one court, and merely conditional in another. A decision of
the Court of Appeal is absolutely binding on a court of first
instance, but is only conditionally binding upon the House
of Lords.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 65. <b>The Disregard of a Precedent.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>In order that a court may be justified in disregarding a
conditionally authoritative precedent, two conditions must be
fulfilled. In the first place, the decision must, in the opinion
of the court in which it is cited, be a <em>wrong</em> decision; and it
is wrong in two distinct cases: first, when it is contrary to
law, and secondly, when it is contrary to reason. It is wrong
as contrary to law, when there is already in existence an
established rule of law on the point in question, and the
decision fails to conform to it. When the law is already
settled, the sole right and duty of the judges is to declare
and apply it. A precedent <em>must</em> be declaratory whenever it
<em>can</em> be, that is to say, whenever there is any law to declare.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in the second place, a decision may be wrong as being
contrary to reason. When there is no settled law to declare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>and follow, the courts may make law for the occasion. In
so doing, it is their duty to follow reason, and so far as they
fail to do so, their decisions are wrong, and the principles
involved in them are of defective authority. Unreasonableness
is one of the vices of a precedent, no less than of a
custom and of certain forms of subordinate legislation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not enough, however, that a decision should be contrary
to law or reason, for there is a second condition to be
fulfilled before the courts are entitled to reject it. If the
first condition were the only one, a conditionally authoritative
precedent would differ in nothing from one which is merely
persuasive. In each case the precedent would be effective
only so far as its own intrinsic merits commended it to the
minds of successive judges. But where a decision is authoritative,
it is not enough that the court to which it is cited
should be of opinion that it is wrong. It is necessary in
innumerable cases to give effect to precedents notwithstanding
that opinion. It does not follow that a principle once
established should be reversed simply because it is not as
perfect and rational as it ought to be. It is often more
important that the law should be certain than that it should
be ideally perfect. These two requirements are to a great
extent inconsistent with each other, and we must often choose
between them. Whenever a decision is departed from, the
certainty of the law is sacrificed to its rational development,
and the evils of the uncertainty thus produced may far outweigh
the very trifling benefit to be derived from the correction
of the erroneous doctrine. The precedent, while it
stood unreversed, may have been counted on in numerous
cases as definitely establishing the law. Valuable property
may have been dealt with in reliance on it; important contracts
may have been made on the strength of it; it may
have become to a great extent a basis of expectation and the
ground of mutual dealings. Justice may therefore imperatively
require that the decision, though founded in error, shall
stand inviolate none the less. <i><span lang="la">Communis error facit jus</span></i>.<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c016'><sup>[161]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“It is better,” said Lord Eldon, “that the law should be
certain than that every judge should speculate upon improvements
in it.”<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c016'><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It follows from this that, other things being equal, a precedent
acquires added authority from the lapse of time. The
longer it has stood unquestioned and unreversed, the more
harm in the way of uncertainty and the disappointment of
reasonable expectations will result from its reversal. A
decision which might be lawfully overruled without hesitation
while yet new, may after the lapse of a number of years
acquire such increased strength as to be practically of absolute
and no longer of merely conditional authority. This effect of
lapse of time has repeatedly received judicial recognition.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Viewed simply as the decision of a court of first instance, the authority
of this case, notwithstanding the respect due to the judges who decided
it, is not binding upon us; but viewed in its character and practical
results, it is one of a class of decisions which acquire a weight and effect
beyond that which attaches to the relative position of the court from
which they proceed. It constitutes an authority which, after it has stood
for so long a period unchallenged, should not, in the interests of public convenience,
and having regard to the protection of private rights, be overruled
by this court except upon very special considerations. For twelve
years and upwards the case has continued unshaken by any judicial decision
or criticism.”<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c016'><sup>[163]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>“When an old decided case has made the law on a particular subject,
the Court of Appeal ought not to interfere with it, because people have
considered it as establishing the law and have acted upon it.”<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c016'><sup>[164]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The statement that a precedent gains in authority with age
must be read subject to an important qualification. Up to
a certain point a human being grows in strength as he grows
in age; but this is true only within narrow limits. So with
the authority of judicial decisions. A moderate lapse of
time will give added vigour to a precedent, but after a still
longer time the opposite effect may be produced, not indeed
directly, but indirectly through the accidental conflict of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>ancient and perhaps partially forgotten principle with later
decisions. Without having been expressly overruled or intentionally
departed from, it may become in course of time no
longer really consistent with the course of judicial decision. In
this way the tooth of time will eat away an ancient precedent,
and gradually deprive it of all its authority. The law becomes
animated by a different spirit and assumes a different course,
and the older decisions become obsolete and inoperative.</p>

<p class='c007'>To sum the matter up, we may say that to justify the disregard
of a conditionally authoritative precedent, it must be
erroneous, either in law or in reason, and the circumstances
of the case must not be such as to make applicable the
maxim, <i><span lang="la">Communis error facit jus.</span></i> The defective decision
must not, by the lapse of time or otherwise, have acquired
such added authority as to give it a title to permanent recognition
notwithstanding the vices of its origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>The disregard of a precedent assumes two distinct forms,
for the court to which it is cited may either overrule it, or
merely refuse to follow it. Overruling is an act of superior
jurisdiction. A precedent overruled is definitely and formally
deprived of all authority. It becomes null and void,
like a repealed statute, and a new principle is authoritatively
substituted for the old. A refusal to follow a precedent, on
the other hand, is an act of co-ordinate, not of superior jurisdiction.
Two courts of equal authority have no power to
overrule each other’s decisions. Where a precedent is merely
not followed, the result is not that the later authority is
substituted for the earlier, but that the two stand side by
side conflicting with each other. The legal antinomy thus
produced must be solved by the act of a higher authority,
which will in due time decide between the competing precedents,
formally overruling one of them, and sanctioning the
other as good law. In the meantime the matter remains at
large, and the law uncertain.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 66. <b>Precedents Constitutive, not Abrogative.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We have already seen the falsity of the theory that all
precedents are declaratory. We have seen that they possess
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>a distinct and legally recognised law-creating power. This
power, however, is purely constitutive and in no degree abrogative.
Judicial decisions may make law, but they cannot
alter it, for where there is settled law already on any point
the duty of the judges is to apply it without question, and
they have no authority to substitute for it law of their own
making. Their legislative power is strictly limited to supplying
the vacancies of the legal system, to filling up with new
law the gaps which exist in the old, to supplementing the
imperfectly developed body of legal doctrine.</p>

<p class='c007'>This statement, however, requires two qualifications. In
the first place, it must be read subject to the undoubted
power of the courts to overrule or disregard precedents in
the manner already described. In its practical effect this is
equivalent to the exercise of abrogative power, but in legal
theory it is not so. The overruling of a precedent is not the
abolition of an established rule of law; it is an authoritative
denial that the supposed rule of law has ever existed. The
precedent is so treated not because it has made bad law, but
because it has never in reality made any law at all. It has
not conformed to the requirements of legal efficacy. Hence
it is that the overruling of a precedent, unlike the repeal of
a statute, has retrospective operation. The decision is pronounced
to have been bad <i><span lang="la">ab initio</span></i>. A repealed statute, on
the contrary, remains valid and applicable as to matters
arising before the date of its repeal. The overruling of a precedent
is analogous not to the repeal of a statute, but to the
judicial rejection of a custom as unreasonable or as otherwise
failing to conform to the requirements of customary law.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the second place, the rule that a precedent has no abrogative
power must be read subject to the maxim, <i><span lang="la">Quod fieri
non debet, factum valet.</span></i> It is quite true that judges ought to
follow the existing law whenever there is any such law to
follow. They are appointed to fulfil the law, not to subvert
it. But if by inadvertence or otherwise this rule is broken
through, and a precedent is established which conflicts with
pre-existing law, it does not follow from this alone that this
decision is destitute of legal efficacy. For it is a well-known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>maxim of the law that a thing which ought not to have been
done may nevertheless be valid when it is done. If, therefore,
a precedent belongs to the class which is absolutely
authoritative, it does not lose this authority simply because
it is contrary to law and ought not to have been made. No
court, for example, will be allowed to disregard a decision of
the House of Lords on such a ground; it must be followed
without question, whether it is in harmony with prior law
or not. So also with those which are merely conditionally
authoritative. We have already seen that error is only one
of two conditions, both of which are requisite to render allowable
the disregard of such a precedent, and in this respect it
makes no difference whether the error consists in a conflict
with law or in a conflict with reason. It may well be better
to adhere to the new law which should not have been made
than to recur to the old law which should not have been displaced.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 67. <b>Grounds of the Authority of Precedents.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The operation of precedents is based on the legal presumption
of the correctness of judicial decisions. It is an application
of the maxim, <i><span lang="la">Res judicata pro veritate accipitur.</span></i> A
matter once formally decided is decided once for all. The
courts will listen to no allegation that they have been mistaken,
nor will they reopen a matter once litigated and determined.
That which has been delivered in judgment must be
taken for established truth. For in all probability it is true
in fact, and even if not, it is expedient that it should be held
as true none the less. <i><span lang="la">Expedit reipublicae ut sit finis litium.</span></i>
When, therefore, a question has once been judicially considered
and answered, it must be answered in the same way
in all subsequent cases in which the same question again
arises. Only through this rule can that consistency of
judicial decision be obtained, which is essential to the proper
administration of justice. Hence the effect of judicial decisions
in excluding the <i><span lang="la">arbitrium judicis</span></i> for the future, in providing
predetermined answers for the questions calling for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>consideration in future cases, and therefore in establishing new
principles of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The questions to which judicial answers are required are
either questions of law or of fact. To both kinds the maxim,
<i><span lang="la">Res judicata pro veritate accipitur</span></i>, is applicable. In the case
of questions of law, this maxim means that the court is presumed
to have correctly ascertained and applied the appropriate
legal principle. The decision operates, therefore, as
proof of the law. It is, or at all events is taken to be, a
declaratory precedent. If the law so declared is at all doubtful,
the precedent will be worth preserving as useful evidence
of it. But if the law is already clear and certain, the precedent
will be useless; to preserve it would needlessly
cumber the books of reports, and it will be allowed to lapse
into oblivion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of questions of fact, on the other hand, the
presumption of the correctness of judicial decisions results in
the creation of new law, not in the declaration and proof of
old. The decision becomes, in a large class of cases, an
original precedent. That is to say, the question thus
answered ceases to be one of fact, and becomes for the future
one of law. For the courts are now provided with a predetermined
answer to it, and it is no longer a matter of free
judicial discretion. The <i><span lang="la">arbitrium judicis</span></i> is now excluded
by one of those fixed and authoritative principles which
constitute the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>For example, the meaning of an ambiguous statute is
at first a pure question of fact. When for the first time the
question arises whether the word “cattle” as used by the
statute includes horses, the court is bound by no authority to
determine the matter in one way or the other. The occasion
is one for the exercise of common sense and interpretative
skill. But when the question has once been decided, it is
for the future one of law and no longer one of fact; for it is
incumbent on the courts in subsequent cases to act on the
maxim <i><span lang="la">Res judicata pro veritate accipitur</span></i>, and to answer the
question in the same way as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>The operation of original precedents is, therefore, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>progressive transformation of questions of fact into questions
of law. <i><span lang="la">Ex facto oritur jus.</span></i> The growth of case-law involves
the gradual elimination of that judicial liberty to which
it owes its origin. In any system in which precedents are
authoritative the courts are engaged in forging fetters for their
own feet. There is of course a limit to this process, for it is
absurd to suppose that the final result of legal development
will be the complete transformation of all questions of fact
into questions of law. The distinction between law and fact
is permanent and essential. What, then, is the limit? To
what extent is precedent capable of effecting this absorption
of fact into law?</p>

<p class='c007'>In respect of this law-creating operation of precedents,
questions of fact are divisible into two classes. For some
of them do, and some do not, admit of being answered <em>on
principle</em>. The former are those the answer to which is
capable of assuming the form of a general principle: the
latter are those the answer to which is necessarily specific.
The former are answered by way of abstraction, that is to
say, by the elimination of the immaterial elements in the
particular case, the result being a general rule applicable not
merely to that single case, but to all others which resemble
it in its essential features. The other class of questions consists
of those in which no such process of abstraction, no such
elimination of immaterial elements, as will give rise to a
general principle, is possible. The answer to them is based
on the circumstances of the concrete and individual case,
and therefore produces no rule of general application. The
operation of precedent is limited to one only of these classes
of questions. Judicial decisions are a source of law only in
the case of those questions of fact which admit of being
answered on principle. These only are transformed by decision
into questions of law, for in this case only does the
judicial decision give rise to a rule which can be adopted for
the future as a rule of law. Those questions which belong
to the other class are permanently questions of fact, and
their judicial solution leaves behind it no permanent results
in the form of legal principles.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>For example, the question whether the defendant did or
did not make a certain statement is a question of fact, which
does not admit of any answer save one which is concrete and
individual. It cannot be answered on principle. It necessarily
remains, therefore, a pure question of fact; the decision
of it is no precedent, and establishes no rule of law. On the
other hand, the question whether the defendant in making
such a statement was or was not guilty of fraud or negligence,
though it may be equally a question of fact, nevertheless belongs
to the other class of such questions. It may well be
possible to lay down a general principle on a matter such as
this. For it is a matter which may be dealt with <i><span lang="la">in abstracto</span></i>,
not necessarily <i><span lang="la">in concreto</span></i>. If, therefore, the decision is
arrived at on principle, it will amount to an original precedent,
and the question, together with every other essentially
resembling it, will become for the future a question of law,
predetermined by the rule thus established.</p>

<p class='c006'>A precedent, therefore, is a judicial decision which contains
in itself a principle. The underlying principle which
thus forms its authoritative element is often termed the <i><span lang="la">ratio
decidendi</span></i>. The concrete decision is binding between the
parties to it, but it is the abstract <i><span lang="la">ratio decidendi</span></i> which alone
has the force of law as regards the world at large. “The
only use of authorities or decided cases,” says Sir George
Jessel, “is the establishment of some principle, which the
judge can follow out in deciding the case before him.”<a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c016'><sup>[165]</sup></a>
“The only thing,” says the same distinguished judge in
another case, “in a judge’s decision binding as an authority
upon a subsequent judge is the principle upon which the
case was decided.”<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c016'><sup>[166]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>This is the true significance of the familiar contrast between
authority and principle. It is often said by judges that inasmuch
as the matter before them is not covered by authority,
they must decide it upon principle. The statement is a sure
indication of the impending establishment of an original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>precedent. It implies two things: first, that where there is
any authority on the point, that is to say, where the question
is already one of law, the duty of the judge is simply to follow
the path so marked out for him; and secondly, that if there
is no authority, and if, therefore, the question is one of pure
fact, it is his duty, if possible, to decide it upon principle,
that is to say, to formulate some general rule and to act upon
it, thereby creating law for the future. It may be, however,
that the question is one which does not admit of being
answered either on authority or on principle, and in such a
case a specific or individual answer is alone possible, no rule
of law being either applied or created.<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c016'><sup>[167]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Although it is the duty of courts of justice to decide
questions of fact on principle if they can, they must take
care in this formulation of principles to limit themselves to
the requirements of the case in hand. That is to say, they
must not lay down principles which are not required for the
due decision of the particular case, or which are wider than
is necessary for this purpose. The only judicial principles
which are authoritative are those which are thus relevant in
their subject-matter and limited in their scope. All others,
at the best, are of merely persuasive efficacy. They are not
true <i><span lang="la">rationes decidendi</span></i>, and are distinguished from them under
the name of <i><span lang="la">dicta</span></i> or <i><span lang="la">obiter dicta</span></i>, things said by the way. The
prerogative of judges is not to make law by formulating and
declaring it—this pertains to the legislature—but to make
law by applying it. Judicial declaration, unaccompanied by
judicial application, is of no authority.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 68. <b>The Sources of Judicial Principles.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Whence, then, do the courts derive those new principles,
or <i><span lang="la">rationes decidendi</span></i>, by which they supplement the existing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>law? They are in truth nothing else than the principles of
natural justice, practical expediency, and common sense.
Judges are appointed to administer justice—justice according
to law, so far as the law extends, but so far as there is
no law, then justice according to nature. Where the civil
law is deficient, the law of nature takes its place, and in so
doing puts on its character also. But the rules of natural
justice are not always such that any man may know them,
and the light of nature is often but an uncertain guide.
Instead of trusting to their own unguided instincts in
formulating the rules of right and reason, the courts are
therefore wisely in the habit of seeking guidance and assistance
elsewhere. In establishing new principles, they willingly
submit themselves to various persuasive influences which,
though destitute of legal authority, have a good claim to
respect and consideration. They accept a principle, for
example, because they find it already embodied in some
system of foreign law. For since it is so sanctioned and
authenticated, it is presumably a just and reasonable one.
In like manner the courts give credence to persuasive precedents,
to judicial <i><span lang="la">dicta</span></i>, to the opinions of text-writers,
and to any other forms of ethical or juridical doctrine which
seem good to them. There is, however, one source of judicial
principles which is of special importance, and calls for
special notice. This is the analogy of pre-existing law.
New rules are very often merely analogical extensions of
the old. The courts seek as far as possible to make the new
law the embodiment and expression of the spirit of the old—of
the <i><span lang="la">ratio juris</span></i>, as the Romans called it. The whole
thereby becomes a single and self-consistent body of legal
doctrine, containing within itself an element of unity and
of harmonious development. At the same time it must be
remembered that analogy is lawfully followed only as a guide
to the rules of natural justice. It has no independent claim
to recognition. Wherever justice so requires, it is the duty
of the courts, in making new law, to depart from the <i><span lang="la">ratio
juris antiqui</span></i>, rather than servilely to follow it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is surprising how seldom we find in judicial utterances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>any explicit recognition of the fact that in deciding questions
on principle, the courts are in reality searching out the rules
and requirements of natural justice and public policy. The
measure of the prevalence of such ethical over purely technical
considerations is the measure in which case-law develops
into a rational and tolerable system as opposed to an unreasoned
product of authority and routine. Yet the official
utterances of the law contain no adequate acknowledgment
of this dependence on ethical influences. “The very considerations,”
it has been well said, “which judges most
rarely mention, and always with an apology, are the secret
root from which the law draws all the juices of life.”<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c016'><sup>[168]</sup></a> The
chief reason of this peculiarity is doubtless to be found in the
fictitious declaratory theory of precedent, and in the forms of
judicial expression and reasoning which this theory has
made traditional. So long as judges affect to be looking
for and declaring old law, they cannot adequately express the
principles on which they are in reality making new.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 69. <b>Respective Functions of Judges and Juries.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The division of judicial functions between judge and jury
creates a difficulty in the theory of precedent which requires
some consideration. It is commonly said that all questions
of fact are for the jury, and all questions of law for the judge.
But we have already seen that original precedents are
answers to questions of fact, transforming them for the future
into questions of law. Are such precedents, then, made by
juries instead of by judges? It is clear that they neither are
nor can be. No jury ever answers a question on principle;
it gives decisions, but no reasons; it decides <i><span lang="la">in concreto</span></i>, not
<i><span lang="la">in abstracto</span></i>. In this respect the judicial action of juries
differs fundamentally from that of judges. The latter decide
on principle, whenever this is possible; they formulate the
<i><span lang="la">ratio decidendi</span></i> which underlies their decision; they strive
after the general and the abstract, instead of adhering to the
concrete and the individual. Hence it is that the decision
of a judge may constitute a precedent, while that of a jury
cannot. But in composite tribunals, where the jury decides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>the facts and the judge the law, how does the judge obtain
any opportunity of establishing precedents and creating new
law? If the matter is already governed by law, it will of
course fall within his province; but if it is not already so
governed, is it not a pure question of fact which must be
submitted to the jury, to the total destruction of all opportunity
of establishing any precedent in respect of it? The
truth of the matter is that, although all questions of law are
for the judge, it is very far from being true that all questions
of fact are for the jury. There are very extensive and important
portions of the sphere of fact which fall within the
jurisdiction of the judge, and it is within those portions that
the law-creating operation of judicial decisions takes place.
No jury, for example, is ever asked to interpret a statute or,
speaking generally, any other written document. Yet unless
there is already some authoritative construction in existence,
this is pure matter of fact. Hence that great department
of case-law which has its origin in the judicial interpretation
of statute law. The general rule—consistently acted on,
though seldom expressly acknowledged—is that a judge will
not submit to a jury any question which he is himself capable
of answering <em>on principle</em>. Such a question he answers for
himself; for since it can be answered on principle, it provides
a fit occasion for the establishment of a precedent and
a new rule of law. It <em>ought</em> to be a matter of law, and can
only become what it ought to be, by being kept from the
jury and answered <i><span lang="la">in abstracto</span></i> by the judge. The only questions
which go to a jury are those questions of fact which
admit of no principle, and are therefore the appropriate
subject-matter of those concrete and unreasoned decisions
which juries give.<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c016'><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>We have said that this rule, though acted on, is not expressly
acknowledged. The reason is that judges are enabled
to avoid the acknowledgment through recourse to the declaratory
theory of precedent. As between judge and jury this
theory is still in full force and effect, although when the rights
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>and privileges of juries are not concerned, the courts are
ready enough at the present day to acknowledge the essential
truth of the matter. As between judge and jury, questions
of fact are withdrawn from the exclusive cognizance of the
latter by means of the legal fiction that they are already
questions of law. They are treated proleptically as being
already that which they are about to become. In a completely
developed legal system they would be already true
questions of law; the principle for their decision would
have been already authoritatively determined. Therefore the
judges make bold to deal with them as being already that
which they ought to be, and thus the making of the law by
way of precedent is prevented from openly infringing upon the
rights of juries to decide all questions which have not already
been decided by the law.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='c013'>LEGAL RIGHTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 70. <b>Wrongs.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We have seen that the law consists of the principles in accordance
with which justice is administered by the state, and that
the administration of justice consists in the use of the physical
force of the state in enforcing rights and punishing the violation
of them. The conception of a right is accordingly one
of fundamental significance in legal theory, and the purpose
of this chapter is to analyse it, and to distinguish its various
applications. Before attempting to define a right, however,
it is necessary to define two other terms which are closely
connected with it, namely, wrong and duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>A wrong is simply a wrong act—an act contrary to the
rule of right and justice. A synonym of it is injury, in its
true and primary sense of <i><span lang="la">injuria</span></i> (that which is contrary to
<i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>), though by a modern perversion of meaning this term
has acquired the secondary sense of harm or damage (<i><span lang="la">damnum</span></i>)
whether rightful or wrongful, and whether inflicted
by human agency or not.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wrongs or injuries are divisible for our present purpose
into two kinds, being either moral or legal. A moral or
natural wrong is an act which is morally or naturally wrong,
being contrary to the rule of natural justice. A legal wrong
is an act which is legally wrong, being contrary to the rule
of legal justice and a violation of the law. It is an act which
is authoritatively determined to be wrong by a rule of law,
and is therefore treated as a wrong in and for the purposes
of the administration of justice by the state. It may or may
not be a wrong in deed and in truth, and conversely a moral
wrong may or may not be a wrong in law. Natural and legal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>wrongs, like natural and legal justice, form intersecting circles,
this discordance between law and fact being partly intentional
and partly the result of imperfect historical development.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all ordinary cases the legal recognition of an act as a
wrong involves the suppression or punishment of it by the
physical force of the state, this being the essential purpose
for which the judicial action of the state is ordained. We
shall see later, however, that such forcible constraint is not
an invariable or essential incident, and that there are other
possible forms of effective legal recognition. The essence of
a legal wrong consists in its recognition as wrong by the law,
not in the resulting suppression or punishment of it. A legal
wrong is a violation of <em>justice according to law</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 71. <b>Duties.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>A duty is an obligatory act, that is to say, it is an act the
opposite of which would be a wrong. Duties and wrongs are
correlatives. The commission of a wrong is the breach of a
duty, and the performance of a duty is the avoidance of a
wrong. A synonym of duty is obligation, in its widest sense,
although in a special and technical application the latter term
denotes one particular kind of duty only, as we shall see later.</p>

<p class='c007'>Duties, like wrongs, are of two kinds, being either moral
or legal. A moral or natural duty is an act the opposite of
which would be a moral or natural wrong. A legal duty is
an act the opposite of which would be a legal wrong. It is
an act recognised as a duty by the law, and treated as such
in and for the purposes of the administration of justice by
the state. These two classes are partly coincident and partly
distinct. A duty may be moral but not legal, or legal but
not moral, or both at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the law recognises an act as a duty, it commonly
enforces the performance of it, or punishes the disregard of
it. But this sanction of legal force is in exceptional cases
absent. A duty is legal because it is legally recognised, not
necessarily because it is legally enforced or sanctioned.
There are legal duties of imperfect obligation, as they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>called, which will be considered by us at a later stage of our
inquiry.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 72. <b>Rights.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>A right is an interest recognised and protected by a rule
of right. It is any interest, respect for which is a duty, and
the disregard of which is a wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>All that is right or wrong, just or unjust, is so by reason
of its effects upon the interests of mankind,<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c016'><sup>[170]</sup></a> that is to say
upon the various elements of human well-being, such as life,
liberty, health, reputation, and the uses of material objects.
If any act is right or just, it is so because and in so far as it
promotes some form of human interest. If any act is wrong
or unjust, it is because the interests of men are prejudicially
affected by it. Conduct which has no influence upon the
interests of any one has no significance either in law or
morals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every wrong, therefore, involves some interest attacked by
it, and every duty involves some interest to which it relates,
and for whose protection it exists. The converse, however,
is not true. Every attack upon an interest is not a wrong,
either in fact or in law, nor is respect for every interest a
duty, either legal or natural. Many interests exist <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i>
and not also <i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i>; they receive no recognition or protection
from any rule of right. The violation of them is no
wrong, and respect for them is no duty. For the interests
of men conflict with each other, and it is impossible for all
to receive rightful recognition. The rule of justice selects
some for protection, and the others are rejected.</p>

<p class='c007'>The interests which thus receive recognition and protection
from the rules of right are called rights. Every man
who has a right to any thing has an interest in it also, but
he may have an interest without having a right. Whether
his interest amounts to a right depends on whether there
exists with respect to it a duty imposed upon any other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>person. In other words, a right is an interest the violation
of which is a wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every right corresponds to a rule of right, from which it
proceeds, and it is from this source that it derives its name.
That I have <em>a right</em> to a thing means that it is <em>right</em> that I
should have that thing. All right is <em>the</em> right of him for whose
benefit it exists, just as all wrong is <em>the</em> wrong of him whose
interests are affected by it. In the words of Windscheid,<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c016'><sup>[171]</sup></a>
“<span lang="de"><em>Das</em> Recht ist <em>sein</em> Recht geworden.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rights, like wrongs and duties, are either moral or legal.
A moral or natural right is an interest recognised and protected
by a rule of natural justice—an interest the violation
of which would be a moral wrong, and respect for which is
a moral duty. A legal right, on the other hand, is an interest
recognised and protected by a rule of legal justice—an interest
the violation of which would be a legal wrong done to
him whose interest it is, and respect for which is a legal
duty. “Rights,” says Ihering,<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c016'><sup>[172]</sup></a> “are legally protected
interests.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bentham set the fashion, still followed by many, of denying
that there are any such things as natural rights at all. All
rights are legal rights and the creation of the law. “Natural
law, natural rights,” he says,<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c016'><sup>[173]</sup></a> “are two kinds of fictions or
metaphors, which play so great a part in books of legislation,
that they deserve to be examined by themselves....
Rights properly so called are the creatures of law properly
so called; real laws give rise to real rights. Natural rights
are the creatures of natural law; they are a metaphor which
derives its origin from another metaphor.” “In many of the
cultivated,” says Spencer,<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c016'><sup>[174]</sup></a> criticising this opinion, “there
has been produced a confirmed and indeed contemptuous
denial of rights. There are no such things, say they, except
such as are conferred by law. Following Bentham, they
affirm that the state is the originator of rights, and that
apart from it there are no rights.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A complete examination of this opinion would lead us far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>into the regions of ethical rather than juridical conceptions,
and would here be out of place. It is sufficient to make two
observations with respect to the matter. In the first place,
he who denies the existence of natural <em>rights</em> must be prepared
at the same time to reject natural or moral <em>duties</em> also.
Rights and duties are essentially correlative, and if a
creditor has no natural right to receive his debt, the debtor
is under no moral duty to pay it to him. In the second
place, he who rejects natural <em>rights</em> must at the same time
be prepared to reject natural <em>right</em>. He must say with the
Greek Sceptics that the distinction between right and wrong,
justice and injustice, is unknown in the nature of things, and
a matter of human institution merely. If there are no
rights save those which the state creates, it logically follows
that nothing is right and nothing wrong save that which the
state establishes and declares as such. If natural justice is a
truth and not a delusion, the same must be admitted of
natural rights.<a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c016'><sup>[175]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>It is to be noticed that in order that an interest should become a legal
right, it must obtain not merely legal protection, but also legal recognition.
The interests of beasts are to some extent protected by the law, inasmuch
as cruelty to animals is a criminal offence. But beasts are not for this
reason possessed of legal rights. The duty of humanity so enforced is not
conceived by the law as a duty <em>towards</em> beasts, but merely as a duty <em>in
respect</em> of them. There is no bond of legal obligation between mankind
and them. The only interest and the only right which the law recognises
in such a case is the interest and right of society as a whole in the welfare
of the animals belonging to it. He who ill-treats a child violates a duty
which he owes to the child, and a right which is vested in him. But he
who ill-treats a dog breaks no <i><span lang="la">vinculum juris</span></i> between him and it, though he
disregards the obligation of humane conduct which he owes to society or
the state, and the correlative right which society or the state possesses.
Similarly a man’s interests may obtain legal protection as against himself,
as when drunkenness or suicide is made a crime. But he has not for this
reason a legal right against himself. The duty to refrain from drunkenness
is not conceived by the law as a duty owing by a man to himself, but
as one owing by him to the community. The only interest which receives
legal recognition is that of the society in the sobriety of its members.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Although a legal right is commonly accompanied by the
power of instituting legal proceedings for the enforcement of
it, this is not invariably the case, and does not pertain to the
essence of the conception. As we shall see, there are classes
of legal rights which are not enforceable by any legal process;
for example, debts barred by prescription or the lapse of time.
Just as there are imperfect and unenforceable legal duties, so
there are imperfect and unenforceable legal rights.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rights and duties are necessarily correlative. There can
be no right without a corresponding duty, or duty without
a corresponding right, any more than there can be a husband
without a wife, or a father without a child. For every duty
must be a duty <em>towards</em> some person or persons, in whom,
therefore, a correlative right is vested. And conversely every
right must be a right <em>against</em> some person or persons, upon
whom, therefore, a correlative duty is imposed. Every right
or duty involves a <i><span lang="la">vinculum juris</span></i> or bond of legal obligation,
by which two or more persons are bound together. There
can be no duty unless there is some one to whom it is due;
there can be no right unless there is some one from whom
it is claimed; and there can be no wrong unless there is
some one who is wronged, that is to say, whose right has been
violated.</p>

<p class='c007'>We must therefore reject the opinion of those writers
who distinguish between <em>relative</em> and <em>absolute</em> duties, the
former being those which have rights corresponding to
them, and the latter being those which have none.<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c016'><sup>[176]</sup></a> This
opinion is held by those who conceive it to be of the essence
of a right, that it should be vested in some determinate
person, and be enforceable by some form of legal process
instituted by him. On this view, duties towards the public
at large or towards indeterminate portions of the public have
no correlative rights; the duty, for example, to refrain from
committing a public nuisance. There seems no sufficient
reason, however, for defining a right in so exclusive a
manner. All duties towards the public correspond to rights
vested in the public, and a public wrong is necessarily the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>violation of a public right. All duties correspond to rights,
though they do not all correspond to private rights vested
in determinate individuals.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 73. <b>The Elements of a Legal Right.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>In every legal right the five following elements are involved:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) A <em>person</em> in whom it is vested, and who may be distinguished
as the <em>owner</em> of the right, the <em>subject</em> of it, or the
person <em>entitled</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) A <em>person</em> against whom the right avails, and upon
whom the correlative duty lies. He may be distinguished
as the person <em>bound</em>, or as the <em>subject</em> of the duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) An <em>act</em> or <em>omission</em> which is obligatory on the person
bound in favour of the person entitled. This may be termed
the <em>content</em> of the right.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) Some <em>thing</em> to which the act or omission relates, and
which may be termed the <em>object</em> or <em>subject-matter</em> of the right.</p>

<p class='c007'>(5) A <em>title</em>: that is to say, certain facts or events by reason
of which the right has become vested in its owner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus if A. buys a piece of land from B., A. is the subject
or owner of the right so acquired. The persons bound by
the correlative duty are persons in general, for a right of this
kind avails against all the world. The content of the right
consists in non-interference with the purchaser’s exclusive
use of the land. The object or subject-matter of the right
is the land. And finally the title of the right is the conveyance
by which it was acquired from its former owner.<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c016'><sup>[177]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Every right, therefore, involves a threefold relation in
which the owner of it stands:—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>(1) It is a right <em>against</em> some <em>person</em> or persons.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) It is a right <em>to</em> some <em>act</em> or omission of such person or
persons.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) It is a right <em>over</em> or <em>to</em> some <em>thing</em> to which that act
or omission relates.</p>

<p class='c007'>An ownerless right is an impossibility. There cannot be
a right without a subject in whom it inheres, any more than
there can be weight without a heavy body; for rights are
merely attributes of persons, and can have no independent
existence. Yet although this is so, the ownership of a right
may be merely contingent or uncertain. The owner of it
may be a person indeterminate. He may even be a person
who is not yet born, and may therefore never come into
existence. Although every right has an owner, it need not
have a <em>vested</em> and <em>certain</em> owner. Thus the fee simple of land
may be left by will to a person unborn at the death of the
testator. To whom does it belong in the meantime? We
cannot say that it belongs to no one, for the reasons already
indicated. We must say that it is presently owned by the
unborn person, but that his ownership is contingent on his
birth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Who is the owner of a debt in the interval between the
death of the creditor intestate and the vesting of his estate
in an administrator? Roman law in such a case personified
the inheritance itself, and regarded the rights contingently
belonging to the heir as presently vested in the inheritance
by virtue of its fictitious personality. According to English
law before the Judicature Act, 1873, the personal property
of an intestate, in the interval between death and the grant
of letters of administration, was deemed to be vested in the
Judge of the Court of Probate, and it may be assumed that
it now vests either in the President of the Probate, Divorce
and Admiralty Division, or in the Judges of the High Court
collectively. But neither the Roman nor the English fiction
is essential. There is no difficulty in saying that the estate
of an intestate is presently owned by an <i><span lang="la">incerta persona</span></i>,
namely by him who is subsequently appointed the administrator
of it. The law, however, abhors a temporary vacuum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>of vested ownership. It prefers to regard all rights as presently
vested in some determinate person, subject, if need
be, to be divested on the happening of the event on which
the title of the contingent owner depends.<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c016'><sup>[178]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Certain writers define the object of a right with such
narrowness that they are forced to the conclusion that there
are some rights which have no objects. They consider that
the object of a right means some material thing to which it
relates; and it is certainly true that in this sense an object
is not an essential element in the conception. Others admit
that a person, as well as a material thing, may be the object
of a right; as in the case of a husband’s right in respect of
his wife, or a father’s in respect of his children. But they
go no further, and consequently deny that the right of
reputation, for example, or that of personal liberty, or the
right of a patentee, or a copyright, has any object at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>The truth seems to be, however, that an object is an
essential element in the idea of a right. A right without
an object in respect of which it exists is as impossible as a
right without a subject to whom it belongs. A right is, as
we have said, a legally protected interest; and the object of
the right is the thing in which the owner has this interest.
It is the thing, material or immaterial, which he desires to
keep or to obtain, and which he is enabled to keep or to
obtain by means of the duty which the law imposes on
other persons. We may illustrate this by classifying the
chief kinds of rights by reference to their objects.</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) <em>Rights over material things.</em>—In respect of their number
and variety, and of the great mass of legal rules relating
to them, these are by far the most important of legal rights.
Their nature is too familiar to require illustration.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) <em>Rights in respect of one’s own person.</em>—I have a right
not to be killed, and the object of this right is my life. I
have a right not to be physically injured or assaulted, and
the object of this right is my bodily health and integrity.
I have a right not to be imprisoned save in due course of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>law; the object of this right is my personal liberty—that is
to say, my power of going where I will. I have a right not
to be coerced or deceived into acting contrary to my desires
or interests; the object of this right is my ability to fulfil
my desires and protect and promote my interests by my
own activities.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) <em>The right of reputation.</em>—In a man’s reputation, that
is to say, in the good opinion that other persons have of
him, he has an interest, just as he has an interest in the
money in his pockets. In each case the interest has obtained
legal recognition and protection as a right, and in each case
the right involves an object in respect of which it exists.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) <em>Rights in respect of domestic relations.</em>—Every man has
an interest and a right in the society, affections, and security
of his wife and children. Any person who without just cause
interferes with this interest, as by the seduction of his wife
or daughter, or by taking away his child, is guilty of a violation
of his rights. The wrongdoer has deprived him of something
which was his, no less than if he had robbed him of his
purse.</p>

<p class='c007'>(5) <em>Rights in respect of other rights.</em>—In many instances a
right has another right as its subject-matter. I may have
a right against A., that he shall transfer to me some right
which is now vested in himself. If I contract with him for
the sale of a piece of land to me, I acquire thereby a right
against him, that he shall so act as to make me the owner
of certain rights now belonging to himself. By the contract
I acquire a right to the right of ownership, and when the
conveyance has been executed, I acquire the right of ownership
itself. Similarly a promise of marriage vests in the
woman a right to the rights of a wife; but the marriage
vests in her those rights themselves.<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c016'><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is commonly a question of importance, whether the
right acquired by an agreement or other transaction is
merely a right to a right, or is one having something else
than another right as its immediate object. If I buy a ton
of coal or a flock of sheep, the right which I thereby acquire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>may be of either of these kinds according to circumstances.
I may become forthwith the owner of the coal or the sheep;
that is to say, my right may have these material things as
its immediate and direct object. On the other hand, I may
acquire merely a right against the seller, that he by delivery
or otherwise shall make me the owner of the things so purchased.
In this case I acquire a right which has, as its immediate
and direct object, nothing more than another right;
though its mediate and indirect object may be said, truly
enough, to be the material things purchased by me.</p>

<p class='c007'>(6) <em>Rights over immaterial property.</em>—Examples of these
are patent rights, copyrights, trade-marks, and commercial
good-will. The object of a patent-right is an invention,
that is to say, the <em>idea</em> of a new process, instrument, or
manufacture. The patentee has a right to the exclusive
use of this idea. Similarly the object of literary copyright
is the form of literary expression produced by the author
of a book. In this he has a valuable interest by reason of
the disposition of the public to purchase copies of the book,
and by the Copyright Act this interest has been raised to
the level of a legal right.</p>

<p class='c007'>(7) <em>Rights to services.</em>—Finally we have to take account of
rights vested in one person to the services of another: the
rights, for example, which are created by a contract between
master and servant, physician and patient, or employer and
workman. In all such cases the object of the right is the
skill, knowledge, strength, time, and so forth, of the person
bound. If I hire a physician, I obtain thereby a right to
the use and benefit of his skill and knowledge, just as, when
I hire a horse, I acquire a right to the use and benefit of his
strength and speed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Or we may say, if we prefer it, that the object of a right
of personal service is the <em>person</em> of him who is bound to
render it. A man may be the subject-matter of rights as
well as the subject of them. His mind and body constitute an
instrument which is capable of certain uses, just as a horse or
a steam-engine is. In a law which recognises slavery, the man
may be bought and sold, just as the horse or steam-engine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>may. But in our own law this is not so, and the only
right that can be acquired over a human being is a temporary
and limited right to the use of him, created by voluntary
agreement with him—not a permanent and general right of
ownership over him.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 74. <b>Legal Rights in a wider sense of the term.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Hitherto we have confined our attention to legal rights in
the strictest and most proper sense. It is in this sense only
that we have regarded them as the correlatives of legal duties,
and have defined them as the interests which the law protects
by imposing duties with respect to them upon other persons.
We have now to notice that the term is also used in a wider
and laxer sense, to include any legally recognised interest,
whether it corresponds to a legal duty or not. In this generic
sense a legal right may be defined as any advantage or benefit
which is in any manner conferred upon a person by a rule of
law. Of rights in this sense there are at least three distinct
kinds, sufficiently important to call for separate classification
and discussion. These are (1) <em>Rights</em> (in the strict sense),
(2) <em>Liberties</em>, and (3) <em>Powers</em>. Having already sufficiently
considered the first of these, we shall now deal briefly with
the others.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 75. <b>Liberties.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Just as my legal rights (in the strict sense) are the benefits
which I derive from legal duties imposed upon other persons,
so my legal liberties are the benefits which I derive from the
absence of legal duties imposed upon myself. They are the
various forms assumed by the interest which I have in doing
as I please. They are the things which I may do without
being prevented by the law. The sphere of my legal liberty
is that sphere of activity within which the law is content to
leave me alone. It is clear that the term right is often used
in a wide sense to include such liberty. I have a right (that
is to say, I am at liberty) to do as I please with my own;
but I have no right and am not at liberty to interfere with
what is another’s. I have a right to express my opinions on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>public affairs, but I have no right to publish a defamatory or
seditious libel. I have a right to defend myself against
violence, but I have no right to take revenge upon him who
has injured me.</p>

<p class='c007'>The interests of unrestrained activity thus recognised and
allowed by the law constitute a class of legal rights clearly
distinguishable from those which we have already considered.
Rights of the one class are concerned with those things
which other persons <em>ought</em> to do for me; rights of the other
class are concerned with those things which I <em>may</em> do for
myself. The former pertain to the sphere of obligation or
compulsion; the latter to that of liberty or free will. Both
are legally recognised interests; both are advantages derived
from the law by the subjects of the state; but they are two
distinct species of one genus.</p>

<p class='c019'>It is often said that all rights whatsoever correspond to duties; and
by those who are of this opinion a different explanation is necessarily
given of the class of rights which we have just considered. It is said that
a legal liberty is in reality a legal right not to be interfered with by other
persons in the exercise of one’s activities. It is alleged that the real meaning
of the proposition that I have a legal right to express what opinions I
please, is that other persons are under a legal duty not to prevent me from
expressing them. So that even in this case the right is the correlative
of a duty. Now there is no doubt that in most cases a legal liberty of
acting is accompanied by a legal right not to be hindered in so acting. If
the law allows me a sphere of lawful and innocent activity, it usually takes
care at the same time to protect this sphere of activity from alien interference.
But in such a case there are in reality two rights and not merely
one; and there are instances in which liberties are not thus accompanied
by protecting rights. I may have a legal liberty which involves no such
duty of non-interference imposed on others. If a landowner gives me a
licence to go upon his land, I have a right to do so, in the sense in which a
right means a liberty; but I have no right to do so, in the sense in which
a right vested in me is the correlative of a duty imposed upon him. Though
I have a liberty or right to go on his land, he has an equal right or liberty
to prevent me. The licence has no other effect than to make that lawful
which would otherwise be unlawful. The right which I so acquire is
nothing more than an extension of the sphere of my rightful activity. So
a trustee has a right to receive from the beneficiaries remuneration for his
trouble in administering the estate, in the sense that in doing so he does
no wrong. But he has no right to receive remuneration, in the sense that
the beneficiaries are under any duty to give it to him. So an alien has a
right, in the sense of liberty, to enter British dominions, but the executive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>government has an equal right, in the same sense, to keep him out.<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c016'><sup>[180]</sup></a> That
I have a right to destroy my property does not mean that it is wrong for
other persons to prevent me; it means that it is not wrong for me so to deal
with that which is my own. That I have no right to commit theft does
not mean that other persons may lawfully prevent me from committing such
a crime, but that I myself act illegally in taking property which is not mine.<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c016'><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 76. <b>Powers.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Yet another class of legal rights consists of those which are
termed powers. Examples of such are the following: the
right to make a will, or to alienate property; the power of
sale vested in a mortgagee; a landlord’s right of re-entry;
the right to marry one’s deceased wife’s sister; that power of
obtaining in one’s favour the judgment of a court of law,
which is called a right of action; the right to rescind a contract
for fraud; a power of appointment; the right of issuing
execution on a judgment; the various powers vested in judges
and other officials for the due fulfilment of their functions.
All these are legal rights—they are legally recognised
interests—they are advantages conferred by the law—but
they are rights of a different species from the two classes
which we have already considered. They resemble liberties,
and differ from rights <i><span lang="la">stricto sensu</span></i>, inasmuch as they have
no duties corresponding to them. My right to make a
will corresponds to no duty in any one else. A mortgagee’s
power of sale is not the correlative of any duty imposed upon
the mortgagor; though it is otherwise with his right to
receive payment of the mortgage debt. A debt is not the
same thing as a right of action for its recovery. The former
is a right in the strict and proper sense, corresponding to the
duty of the debtor to pay; the latter is a legal power, corresponding
to the liability of the debtor to be sued. That
the two are distinct appears from the fact that the right of
action may be destroyed (as by prescription) while the debt
remains.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>It is clear, therefore, that a power is not the same thing
as a right of the first class. Neither is it identical with a
right of the second class, namely, a liberty. That I have a
right to make a will does not mean that in doing so I do no
wrong. It does not mean that I <em>may</em> make a will innocently;
it means that I <em>can</em> make a will effectively. That I have a
right to marry my cousin does not mean that such a marriage
is legally innocent, but that it is legally valid. It is
not a liberty that I have, but a power. That a landlord has
a right of re-entry on his tenant does not mean that in re-entering
he does the tenant no wrong, but that by so doing he
effectively terminates the lease.<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c016'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A power may be defined as ability conferred upon a person
by the law to determine, by his own will directed to that end,
the rights, duties, liabilities, or other legal relations, either
of himself or of other persons. Powers are either public or
private. The former are those which are vested in a person
as an agent or instrument of the functions of the state; they
comprise the various forms of legislative, judicial, and executive
authority. Private powers, on the other hand, are
those which are vested in persons to be exercised for their
own purposes, and not as agents of the state. Power is
either ability to determine the legal relations of other persons,
or ability to determine one’s own. The first of these—power
over other persons—is commonly called <em>authority</em>; the
second—power over oneself—is usually termed <em>capacity</em>.<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c016'><sup>[183]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>These, then, are the three chief classes of benefits, privileges,
or rights conferred by the law: liberty, when the law
allows to my will a sphere of unrestrained activity; power,
when the law actively assists me in making my will effective;
right in the strict sense, when the law limits the liberty of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>others in my behalf. A liberty is that which I <em>may</em> do innocently;
a power is that which I <em>can</em> do effectively; a right in
the narrow sense is that which other persons <em>ought</em> to do on my
behalf. I use my liberties with the acquiescence of the law;
I use my powers with its active assistance in making itself the
instrument of my will; I enjoy my rights through the control
exercised by it over the acts of others on my behalf.<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c016'><sup>[184]</sup></a><a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c016'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 77. <b>Duties, Disabilities, and Liabilities.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>There is no generic term which is the correlative of right in
the wide sense, and includes all the burdens imposed by the
law, as a right includes all the benefits conferred by it. These
legal burdens are of three kinds, being either <em>Duties</em>, <em>Disabilities</em>,
or <em>Liabilities</em>. A duty is the absence of liberty; a disability
is the absence of power; a liability is the presence
either of liberty or of power vested in some one else as against
the person liable. Examples of liabilities correlative to
liberties are the liability of a trespasser to be forcibly ejected,
that of a defaulting tenant to have his goods seized for rent,
and that of the owner of a building to have his windows
darkened or his foundations weakened by the building or
excavations of his neighbours. Examples of liabilities correlative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>to powers are the liability of a tenant to have his
lease determined by re-entry, that of a mortgagor to have the
property sold by the mortgagee, that of a judgment debtor
to have execution issued against him, and that of an unfaithful
wife to be divorced.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most important form of liability is that which corresponds
to the various powers of action and prosecution
arising from the different forms of wrongdoing. There is
accordingly a narrow sense of the word liability, in which it
covers this case exclusively. Liability in this sense is the
correlative of a legal remedy. A synonym for it is responsibility.
It is either civil or criminal according as it corresponds
to a right of action or to a right of prosecution.<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c016'><sup>[186]</sup></a><a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c016'><sup>[187]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.<br> <span class='c013'>THE KINDS OF LEGAL RIGHTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 78. <b>Perfect and Imperfect Rights.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Recognition by the law in the administration of justice is
common to all legal rights and duties, but the purposes and
effects of this recognition are different in different cases. All
are not recognised to the same end. Hence a division of rights
and duties into two kinds, distinguishable as <em>perfect</em> and <em>imperfect</em>.
A perfect right is one which corresponds to a perfect
duty; and a perfect duty is one which is not merely recognised
by the law, but <em>enforced</em>. A duty is enforceable when
an action or other legal proceeding, civil or criminal, will lie
for the breach of it, and when judgment will be executed
against the defendant, if need be, through the physical force
of the state.<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c016'><sup>[188]</sup></a> Enforceability is the general rule. In all
ordinary cases, if the law will recognise a right at all, it will
not stop short of the last remedy of physical compulsion
against him on whom the correlative duty lies. <em>Ought</em>, in
the mouth of the law, commonly means <em>must</em>. In all fully
developed legal systems, however, there are rights and duties
which, though undoubtedly recognised by the law, yet fall
short of this typical and perfect form.<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c016'><sup>[189]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Examples of such imperfect legal rights are claims barred
by lapse of time; claims unenforceable by action owing to the
absence of some special form of legally requisite proof (such
as a written document); claims against foreign states or
sovereigns, as for interest due on foreign bonds; claims
unenforceable by action as exceeding the local limits of a
court’s jurisdiction, such as claims in respect of foreign
land; debts due to an executor from the estate which he
administers. In all those cases the duties and the correlative
rights are imperfect. No action will lie for their maintenance;
yet they are, for all that, legal rights and legal duties,
for they receive recognition from the law. The statute of
limitations, for example, does not provide that after a certain
time a debt shall become extinct, but merely that no action
shall thereafter be brought for its recovery. Lapse of time,
therefore, does not destroy the right, but merely reduces it
from the rank of one which is perfect to that of one which
is imperfect. It remains valid for all purposes save that of
enforcement. In like manner he from whom a chattel is
taken wrongfully, and detained for six years, loses all right
to sue the taker for its recovery; but he does not cease to
be the owner of it. Nor is his ownership merely an empty
title; for in divers ways it may lead him, with the assistance
of the law, to the possession and enjoyment of his own again.
All these cases of imperfect rights are exceptions to the
maxim, <i><span lang="la">Ubi jus ibi remedium</span></i>. The customary union between
the right and the right of action has been for some special
reason severed, but the right survives.</p>

<p class='c007'>For what purposes the law will recognise an imperfect right
is a question relating to the concrete details of a legal system,
and cannot be fully discussed here. We may, however, distinguish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>the following effects as those of greatest importance
and most general application.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. An imperfect right may be good as a ground of defence,
though not as a ground of action. I cannot sue on an informal
contract, but if money is paid or property delivered
to me in pursuance of it, I can successfully defend any claim
for its recovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. An imperfect right is sufficient to support any security
that has been given for it. A mortgage or pledge remains
perfectly valid, although the debt secured by it has ceased
to be recoverable by action.<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c016'><sup>[190]</sup></a> But if the debt is discharged,
instead of becoming merely imperfect, the security will disappear
along with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. An imperfect right may possess the capacity of becoming
perfect. The right of action may not be non-existent,
but may be merely dormant. An informal verbal contract
may become enforceable by action, by reason of the fact that
written evidence of it has since come into existence. In like
manner part-payment or acknowledgment will raise once
more to the level of a perfect right a debt that has been barred
by the lapse of time.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 79. <b>The Legal Nature of Rights against the State.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>A subject may claim rights against the state, no less than
against another subject. He can institute proceedings
against the state for the determination and recognition of
those rights in due course of law, and he can obtain judgment
in his favour, recognising their existence or awarding to him
compensation for their infringement. But there can be no
<em>enforcement</em> of that judgment. What duties the state recognises
as owing by it to its subjects, it fulfils of its own free
will and unconstrained good pleasure. The strength of the
law is none other than the strength of the state, and cannot
be turned or used against the state whose strength it is.
The rights of the subject against the state are therefore imperfect.
They obtain legal recognition but no legal enforcement.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>The fact that the element of enforcement is thus absent
in the case of rights against the state, has induced many
writers to deny that these are legal rights at all. But as we
have already seen, we need not so narrowly define the term
legal right, as to include only those claims that are legally
enforced. It is equally logical and more convenient to include
within the term all those claims that are legally recognised
in the administration of justice. All rights against the
state are not legal, any more than all rights against private
persons are legal. But some of them are; those, namely,
which can be sued for in courts of justice, and the existence
and limits of which will be judicially determined in accordance
with fixed principles of law, redress or compensation
being awarded for any violation of them. To hold the contrary,
and to deny the name of legal right or duty in all cases
in which the state is the defendant, is to enter upon a grave
conflict with legal and popular speech and thought. In the
language of lawyers, as in that of laymen, a contract with
the state is as much a source of legal rights and obligations,
as is a contract between two private persons; and the right
of the holder of consols is as much a legal right, as is that
of a debenture holder in a public company. It is not to the
point to say that rights against the state are held at the state’s
good pleasure, and are therefore not legal rights at all; for
all other legal rights are in the same position. They are legal
rights not because the state is bound to recognise them, but
because it does so.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether rights against the state can properly be termed
legal depends simply on whether judicial proceedings in which
the state is the defendant are properly included within the
administration of justice. For if they are rightly so included,
the principles by which they are governed are true principles
of law, in accordance with the definition of law, and the
rights defined by these legal principles are true legal rights.
The boundary line of the administration of justice has been
traced in a previous chapter. We there saw sufficient reason
for including not only the direct enforcement of justice, but
all other judicial functions exercised by courts of justice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>This is the ordinary use of the term, and it seems open to no
logical objection.<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c016'><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 80. <b>Positive and Negative Rights.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>In respect of their contents, rights are of two kinds, being
either <em>positive</em> or <em>negative</em>. A positive right corresponds to a
positive duty, and is a right that he on whom the duty lies
shall do some positive act on behalf of the person entitled.
A negative right corresponds to a negative duty, and is a right
that the person bound shall refrain from some act which would
operate to the prejudice of the person entitled. The same
distinction exists in the case of wrongs. A positive wrong
or wrong of commission is the breach of a negative duty and
the violation of a negative right. A negative wrong or wrong
of omission is the breach of a positive duty, and the infringement
of a positive right. A negative right entitles the owner
of it to the maintenance of the present position of things; a
positive right entitles him to an alteration of this position
for his advantage. The former is merely a right not to be
harmed; the latter is a right to be positively benefited. The
former is a right to retain what one already has; the latter
is a right to receive something more than one already has.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of a negative right the interest which is its <i><span lang="la">de
facto</span></i> basis is of such a nature that it requires for its adequate
maintenance or protection nothing more than the passive
acquiescence of other persons. All that is asked by the owner
of the interest is to be left alone in the enjoyment of it. In
the case of a positive right, on the other hand, the interest is
of a less perfect and self-sufficient nature, inasmuch as the
person entitled requires for the realisation and enjoyment of
his right the active assistance of other persons. In the
former case I stand in an immediate and direct relation to the
object of my right, and claim from others nothing more than
that they shall not interfere between me and it. In the latter
case I stand in a mediate and indirect relation to the object,
so that I can attain to it only through the active help of
others. My right to the money in my pocket is an example
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>of the first class; my right to the money in the pocket of my
debtor is an instance of the second.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distinction is one of practical importance. It is much
easier, as well as much more necessary, for the law to prevent
the infliction of harm than to enforce positive beneficence.
Therefore while liability for hurtful acts of commission is the
general rule, liability for acts of omission is the exception.
Generally speaking, all men are bound to refrain from all
kinds of positive harm, while only some men are bound in
some ways actively to confer benefits on others. No one is
entitled to do another any manner of hurt, save with special
ground of justification; but no one is bound to do another
any manner of good save on special grounds of obligation.
Every man has a right against every man that the present
position of things shall not be interfered with to his detriment;
whilst it is only in particular cases and for special
reasons that any man has a right against any man that the
present position shall be altered for his advantage. I have a
right against every one not to be pushed into the water; if I
have a right at all to be pulled out, it is only on special grounds
against determinate individuals.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 81. <b>Real and Personal Rights.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The distinction between real and personal rights is closely
connected but not identical with that between negative and
positive rights. It is based on a difference in the incidence of
the correlative duties. A real right corresponds to a duty imposed
upon persons in general; a personal right corresponds
to a duty imposed upon determinate individuals. A real
right is available against the world at large; a personal right
is available only against particular persons. The distinction
is one of great prominence in the law, and we may take the
following as illustrations of it. My right to the peaceable
occupation of my farm is a real right, for all the world is under
a duty towards me not to interfere with it. But if I grant a
lease of the farm to a tenant, my right to receive the rent from
him is personal; for it avails exclusively against the tenant
himself. For the same reason my right to the possession and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>use of the money in my purse is real; but my right to receive
money from some one who owes it to me is personal. I have
a real right against every one not to be deprived of my liberty
or my reputation; I have a personal right to receive compensation
from any individual person who has imprisoned
or defamed me. I have a real right to the use and occupation
of my own house; I have a personal right to receive accommodation
at an inn.</p>

<p class='c007'>A real right, then, is an interest protected against the world
at large; a personal right is an interest protected solely
against determinate individuals. The distinction is clearly
one of importance. The law confers upon me a greater advantage
in protecting my interests against all persons, than
in protecting them only against one or two. The right of a
patentee, who has a monopoly as against all the world, is
much more valuable than the right of him who purchases the
good-will of a business and is protected only against the competition
of his vendor. If I buy a chattel, it is an important
question, whether my interest in it is forthwith protected
against every one, or only against him who sells it to me.
The main purpose of mortgages and other forms of real
security is to supplement the imperfections of a personal right
by the superior advantages inherent in a right of the other
class. Furthermore, these two kinds of rights are necessarily
very different in respect of the modes of their creation and
extinction. The indeterminate incidence of the duty which
corresponds to a real right, renders impossible many modes
of dealing with it which are of importance in the case of
personal rights.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distinction which we are now considering is closely
connected with that between positive and negative rights.
All real rights are negative, and most personal rights are
positive, though in a few exceptional cases they are negative.
It is not difficult to see the reason for this complete or partial
coincidence. A real right, available against all other
persons, can be nothing more than a right to be left alone
by those persons—a right to their passive non-interference.
No person can have a legal right to the active assistance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>all the world. The only duties, therefore, that can be of
general incidence are negative. It may be objected to this,
that though a private person cannot have a positive right
against all other persons, yet the state may have such a right
against all its subjects. All persons, for example, may be
bound to pay a tax or to send in census returns. Are not
these duties of general incidence, and yet positive? The
truth is, however, that the right of the state in all such cases
is personal and not real. The right to receive a tax is not
one right, but as many separate rights as there are taxpayers.
If I owe ten pounds to the state as income tax, the
right of the state against me is just as personal as is that of
any other creditor, and it does not change its nature because
other persons or even all my fellow-citizens owe a similar
amount on the like account. My debt is not theirs, nor are
their debts mine. The state has not one real right available
against all, but an immense number of personal rights, each
of which avails against a determinate tax-payer. On the
other hand, the right of the state that no person shall trespass
on a piece of Crown land is a single interest protected against
all the world, and is therefore a single real right. The unity
of a real right consists in the singleness of its subject-matter.
The right of reputation is <em>one</em> right, corresponding to an infinite
number of duties; for the subject-matter is one thing,
belonging to one person, and protected against all the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although all real rights are negative, it is not equally true
that all personal rights are positive. This is so, indeed, in
the great majority of cases. The merely passive duty of non-interference,
when it exists at all, usually binds all persons in
common. There are, however, exceptional cases in which this
is not so. These exceptional rights, which are both negative
and personal, are usually the product of some agreement by
which some particular individual has deprived himself of a
liberty which is common to all other persons. Thus all tradesmen
may lawfully compete with each other in the ordinary
way of business, even though the result of this competition
is the ruin of the weaker competitors. But in selling to
another the good-will of my business I may lawfully deprive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>myself of this liberty by an express agreement with the purchaser
to that effect. He thereby acquires against me a right
of exemption from competition, and this right is both personal
and negative. It is a monopoly, protected not against the
world at large, but against a determinate individual. Such
rights belong to an intermediate class of small extent, standing
between rights which are both real and negative on the
one side and those which are both personal and positive on
the other.</p>

<p class='c019'>In defining a real right as one availing against the world at large, it is
not meant that the incidence of the correlative duty is absolutely universal,
but merely that the duty binds persons in general, and that if any one is
not bound his case is exceptional. Similarly a personal right is not one
available against a single person only, but one available against one or more
<em>determinate</em> individuals. The right of the creditor of a firm is personal,
though the debt may be due from any number of partners. Even as so
explained, however, it can scarcely be denied, that if intended as an exhaustive
classification of all possible cases, the distinction between real and
personal rights—between duties of general and of determinate incidence—is
logically defective. It takes no account of the possibility of a third and
intermediate class. Why should there not be rights available against
particular classes of persons, as opposed both to the whole community and
to persons individually determined, for example, a right available only
against aliens? An examination, however, of the contents of any actual
legal system will reveal the fact that duties of this suggested description
either do not exist at all, or are so exceptional that we are justified in
classing them as anomalous. As a classification, therefore, of the rights
which actually obtain legal recognition, the distinction between real and
personal rights may be accepted as valid.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distinction between a real and a personal right is otherwise
expressed by the terms right <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i> (or <i><span lang="la">in re</span></i>) and right
<i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>. These expressions are derived from the commentators
on the civil and canon law. Literally interpreted,
<i><span lang="la">jus in rem</span></i> means a right against or in respect of a thing, <i><span lang="la">jus in
personam</span></i> a right against or in respect of a person. In truth,
however, every right is at the same time one in respect of some
thing, namely its object, and against some person, namely,
the person bound. In other words, every right involves not
only a <em>real</em>, but also a <em>personal</em> relation. Yet although these
two relations are necessarily coexistent, their relative prominence
and importance are not always the same. In real
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>rights it is the real relation that stands in the forefront of
the juridical conception; such rights are emphatically and
conspicuously <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i>. In personal rights, on the other hand,
it is the personal relation that forms the predominant factor
in the conception; such rights are before all things <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>.
For this difference there is more than one reason.
In the first place, the real right is a relation between the
owner and a vague multitude of persons, no one of whom is
distinguished from any other; while a personal right is a
definite relation between determinate individuals, and the
definiteness of this personal relation raises it into prominence.
Secondly, the source or title of a real right is commonly to
be found in the character of the real relation, while a personal
right generally derives its origin from the personal relation.
In other words, if the law confers upon me a real right, it is
commonly because I stand in some special relation to the
thing which is the object of the right. If on the contrary
it confers on me a personal right, it is commonly because I
stand in some special relation to the person who is the subject
of the correlative duty. If I have a real right in a material
object, it is because I made it, or found it, or first acquired
possession of it, or because by transfer or otherwise I have
taken the place of some one who did originally stand in some
such relation to it. But if I have a personal right to receive
money from another, it is commonly because I have made a
contract with him, or have come in some other manner to
stand in a special relation to him. Each of these reasons
tends to advance the importance of the real relation in real
rights, and that of the personal relation in personal rights.
The former are primarily and pre-eminently <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i>; the
latter primarily and pre-eminently <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commonest and most important kind of <i><span lang="la">jus in personam</span></i>
is that which has been termed by the civilians and
canonists <i><span lang="la">jus ad rem</span></i>. I have a <i><span lang="la">jus ad rem</span></i>, when I have a
right that some other right shall be transferred to me or otherwise
vested in me. <i><span lang="la">Jus ad rem</span></i> is a right to a right. We have
already seen, in the previous chapter, that it is possible for
one right to be in this way the subject-matter of another.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>A debt, a contract to assign property, and a promise of marriage
are examples of this. It is clear that such a right to a
right must be in all cases <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>. The right which is to
be transferred, however—the subject-matter of the <i><span lang="la">jus ad rem</span></i>—may
be either real or personal, though it is more commonly
real. I may agree to assign or mortgage a debt, or the benefit
of a contract, no less than lands or chattels. An agreement
to assign a chattel creates a <i><span lang="la">jus ad jus in rem</span></i>; an agreement
to assign a debt or a contract creates a <i><span lang="la">jus ad jus in personam</span></i>.<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c016'><sup>[192]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>The terms <i><span lang="la">jus in rem</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">jus in personam</span></i> were invented by the commentators
on the civil law, and are not found in the original sources. The
distinction thereby expressed, however, received adequate recognition from
the Roman lawyers. They drew a broad line of demarcation between
<i><span lang="la">dominium</span></i> on the one side and <i><span lang="la">obligatio</span></i> on the other, the former including
real, and the latter personal rights. <i><span lang="la">Dominium</span></i> is the relation between the
owner of a real right (<em>dominus</em>) and the right so vested in him. <i><span lang="la">Obligatio</span></i>
is the relation between the owner of a personal right (<em>creditor</em>) and the
person on whom the correlative duty lies. <i><span lang="la">Obligatio</span></i>, in other words, is the
legal bond by which two or more determinate individuals are bound
together. Our modern English obligation has lost this specific meaning,
and is applied to any duty, whether it corresponds to a real or to a personal
right. It is to be noticed, however, that both <i><span lang="la">dominium</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">obligatio</span></i> are
limited by the Romans to the sphere of what, in the succeeding part of this
chapter, we term proprietary rights. A man’s right to his personal liberty
or reputation, for example, falls neither within the sphere of <i><span lang="la">dominium</span></i>
nor within that of <i><span lang="la">obligatio</span></i>. The distinction between real and personal
rights, on the other hand, is subject to no such limitation.</p>

<p class='c019'>The terms <i><span lang="la">jus in rem</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">jus in personam</span></i> are derived from the Roman
terms <i><span lang="la">actio in rem</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">actio in personam</span></i>. An <i><span lang="la">actio in rem</span></i> was an action
for the recovery of <i><span lang="la">dominium</span></i>; one in which the plaintiff claimed that a
certain thing belonged to him and ought to be restored or given up to him.
An <i><span lang="la">actio in personam</span></i> was one for the enforcement of an <i><span lang="la">obligatio</span></i>; one in
which the plaintiff claimed the payment of money, the performance of a
contract, or the protection of some other personal right vested in him as
against the defendant.<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c016'><sup>[193]</sup></a> Naturally enough, the right protected by an
<i><span lang="la">actio in rem</span></i> came to be called <i><span lang="la">jus in rem</span></i>, and a right protected by an <i><span lang="la">actio
in personam, jus in personam</span></i>.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 82. <b>Proprietary and Personal Rights.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Another important distinction is that between proprietary
and personal rights. The aggregate of a man’s proprietary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>rights constitutes his <em>estate</em>, his <em>assets</em>, or his <em>property</em> in one
of the many senses of that most equivocal of legal terms.
German jurisprudence is superior to our own in possessing a
distinct technical term for this aggregate of proprietary rights,
namely <i><span lang="de">Vermögen</span></i>, the rights themselves being <i><span lang="de">Vermögensrechte</span></i>.
The French speak in the same fashion of <i><span lang="fr">avoir</span></i> or
<i><span lang="fr">patrimoine</span></i>. The sum total of a man’s personal rights, on the
other hand, constitutes his <em>status</em> or personal condition, as
opposed to his estate. If he owns land, or chattels, or patent
rights, or the good-will of a business, or shares in a company,
or if debts are owing to him, all these rights pertain to his
estate. But if he is a free man and a citizen, a husband and a
father, the rights which he has as such pertain to his status
or standing in the law.<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c016'><sup>[194]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>What, then, is the essential nature of this distinction? It
lies in the fact that proprietary rights are <em>valuable</em>, and personal
rights are not. The former are those which are worth
money; the latter are those that are worth none. The former
are the elements of a man’s <em>wealth</em>; the latter are
merely elements in his <em>well-being</em>. The former possess not
merely juridical, but also economic significance; while the
latter possess juridical significance only.<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c016'><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It makes no difference in this respect, whether a right is
<i><span lang="la">jus in rem</span></i> or <i><span lang="la">jus in personam</span></i>. Rights of either sort are proprietary,
and make up the estate of the possessor, if they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>are of economic value. Thus my right to the money in my
pocket is proprietary; but not less so is my right to the
money which I have in the bank. Stock in the funds is
part of a man’s estate, just as much as land and houses; and
a valuable contract, just as much as a valuable chattel. On
the other hand, a man’s rights of personal liberty, and of
reputation, and of freedom from bodily harm are personal,
not proprietary. They concern his welfare, not his wealth;
they are juridical merely, not also economic. So also with
the rights of a husband and father with respect to his wife
and children. Rights such as these constitute his legal
status, not his legal estate. If we go outside the sphere of
private, into that of public law, we find the list of personal
rights greatly increased. Citizenship, honours, dignities, and
official position in all its innumerable forms pertain to the
law of status, not to that of property.<a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c016'><sup>[196]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>With respect to the distinction between proprietary and personal
rights—estate and status—there are the following supplementary observations
to be made.</p>

<p class='c019'>1. The distinction is not confined to rights in the strict sense, but
is equally applicable to other classes of rights also. A person’s estate is
made up not merely of his valuable claims against other persons, but of
such of his powers and liberties, as are either valuable in themselves, or are
accessory to other rights which are valuable. A landlord’s right of re-entry
is proprietary, no less than his ownership of the land; and a mortgagee’s
right of sale, no less than the debt secured. A general power of
appointment is proprietary, but the power of making a will or a contract is
personal.</p>

<p class='c019'>2. The distinction between personal and proprietary rights has its
counterpart in that between personal and proprietary duties and liabilities.
The latter are those which relate to a person’s estate, and diminish the
value of it. They represent a loss of money, just as a proprietary right
represents the acquisition of it. All others are personal. A liability to be
sued for a debt is proprietary, but a liability to be prosecuted for a crime is
personal. The duty of fulfilling a contract for the purchase of goods is
proprietary, but the duty of fulfilling a contract to marry is personal.</p>

<p class='c019'>3. Although the term estate includes only rights (in the generic sense),
the term status includes not only rights, but also duties, liabilities, and
disabilities. A minor’s contractual disabilities are part of his status,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>though a man’s debts are not part of his estate. Status is the sum of one’s
personal duties, liabilities, and disabilities, as well as of one’s personal
rights.</p>

<p class='c019'>4. A person’s status is made up of smaller groups of personal rights,
duties, liabilities, and disabilities, and each of these constituent groups is
itself called a status. Thus the same person may have at the same time
the status of a free man, of a citizen, of a husband, of a father, and so on.
So we speak of the status of a wife, meaning all the personal benefits and
burdens of which marriage is the legal source and title in a woman. In the
same way we speak of the status of an alien, a lunatic, or an infant.</p>

<p class='c019'>5. It may be thought that proprietary rights should be defined as those
which are transferable, rather than as those which are valuable. As to this,
it seems clear that all transferable rights are also proprietary; for if they
can be transferred, they can be sold, and are therefore worth money. But
it is not equally true that all proprietary rights are transferable. Popular
speech does not, and legal theory need not, deny the name of property to a
valuable right, merely because it is not transferable. A pension may be
inalienable; but it must be counted, for all that, as wealth or property.
Debts were originally incapable of assignment; but even then they were
elements of the creditor’s estate. A married woman may be unable to
alienate her estate; but it is an estate none the less. The true test of a
proprietary right is not whether it can be alienated, but whether it is
equivalent to money; and it may be equivalent to money, though it cannot
be sold for a price. A right to receive money or something which can
itself be turned into money, is a proprietary right, and is to be reckoned in
the possessor’s estate, even though inalienable.</p>

<p class='c019'>6. It is an unfortunate circumstance that the term status is used in a
considerable variety of different senses. Of these we may distinguish the
following:</p>

<p class='c023'>(a) <em>Legal condition of any kind, whether personal or proprietary.</em> This
is the most comprehensive use of the term. A man’s status in this
sense includes his whole position in the law—the sum total of his
legal rights, duties, liabilities, or other legal relations, whether proprietary
or personal, or any particular group of them separately
considered. Thus we may speak of the status of a landowner,
of a trustee, of an executor, of a solicitor, and so on. It is much
more common, however, to confine the term in question to some
particular description of legal condition—some particular kind of
status in this wide sense. Hence the other and specific meanings
of the term.</p>

<p class='c023'>(b) <em>Personal legal condition</em>; that is to say, a man’s legal condition,
only so far as his personal rights and burdens are concerned, to the
exclusion of his proprietary relations. It is in this sense that we
have hitherto used the term. Thus we speak of the status of an
infant, of a married woman, of a father, of a public official, or of a
citizen; but not of a landowner or of a trustee.</p>

<p class='c023'>(c) <em>Personal capacities and incapacities</em>, as opposed to the other elements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>of personal status. By certain writers the term status is
applied not to the whole sphere of personal condition, but only to
one part of it, namely that which relates to personal capacity and
incapacity.<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c016'><sup>[197]</sup></a> The law of status in this sense would include the rules
as to the contractual capacities and incapacities of married women,
but not the personal rights and duties existing between her and her
husband. So it would include the law as to infant’s contracts, but
not the law as to the mutual rights of parent and child. This law of
status in the sense of personal capacity is considered as a special
branch of the law, introductory to the main body of legal doctrine,
on the ground that a knowledge of the different capacities of different
classes of persons to acquire rights and to enter into legal
relations is pre-supposed in the exposition of those rights and legal
relations themselves. It cannot be doubted that there are certain
rules which so permeate the law, that it is necessary in any well-arranged
system to dispose of them once for all in a preliminary
portion of the code, instead of constantly repeating them in connexion
with every department of the law in which they are relevant;
but it may be doubted whether the rules of personal capacity belong
to this category. Surely the contractual capacity of a minor is best
dealt with in the law of contracts, his capacity to commit a tort in
the law of tort, his capacity to commit a crime in the criminal law,
his capacity to marry in the law of marriage. Moreover, even if
personal capacity is a suitable subject for separate and introductory
treatment in the law, there seems little justification for confining
the term status to this particular branch of personal condition.</p>

<p class='c023'>(d) <em>Compulsory as opposed to conventional personal condition.</em> Status is
used by some writers to signify a man’s personal legal condition, so
far only as it is imposed upon him by the law without his own consent,
as opposed to the condition which he has acquired for himself
by agreement. The position of a slave is a matter of status, the
position of a free servant is a matter of contract. Marriage creates
a status in this sense, for although it is entered into by way of consent,
it cannot be dissolved in that way, and the legal condition
created by it is determined by the law, and cannot be modified
by the agreement of the parties. A business partnership, on the
other hand, pertains to the law of contract, and not to that of
status.<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c016'><sup>[198]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>7. <em>The law of persons and the law of things.</em> Certain of the Roman
lawyers, for example Gaius, divided the whole of the substantive law
into two parts, which they distinguished as <i><span lang="la">jus quod ad personas pertinet</span></i>
and <i><span lang="la">jus quod ad res pertinet</span></i>, terms which are commonly translated as the
law of persons and the law of things. There has been much discussion as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>to the precise significance of this distinction, and it is possible that it was
based on no clear and consistent logical analysis at all. Any adequate investigation
of the matter would here be out of place, but it is suggested
that the true basis of the division is the distinction between personal and
proprietary rights, between status and property. The <i><span lang="la">jus quod ad res
pertinet</span></i> is the law of property, the law of proprietary rights; the <i><span lang="la">jus quod
ad personas pertinet</span></i> is the law of status, the law of personal rights, so far as
such rights require separate consideration, instead of being dealt with in
connexion with those portions of the law of property to which they are immediately
related.<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c016'><sup>[199]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 83. <b>Rights in <span lang="la">re propria</span> and Rights in <span lang="la">re aliena</span>.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Rights may be divided into two kinds, distinguished by
the civilians as <i><span lang="la">jura in re propria</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">jura in re aliena</span></i>. The
latter may also be conveniently termed <em>encumbrances</em>, if we
use that term in its widest permissible sense.<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c016'><sup>[200]</sup></a> A right <i><span lang="la">in
re aliena</span></i> or encumbrance is one which limits or derogates
from some more general right belonging to some other
person in respect of the same subject-matter. All others are
<i><span lang="la">jura in re propria</span></i>. It frequently happens that a right
vested in one person becomes subject or subordinate to an
adverse right vested in another. It no longer possesses its
full scope or normal compass, part of it being cut off to
make room for the limiting and superior right which thus
derogates from it. Thus the right of a landowner may be
subject to and limited by that of a tenant to the temporary
use of the property; or to the right of a mortgagee to sell
or take possession; or to the right of a neighbouring
landowner to the use of a way or other easement; or to
the right of the vendor of land in respect of restrictive
covenants entered into by the purchaser as to the use of it;
for example, a covenant not to build upon it.</p>

<p class='c006'>A right subject to an encumbrance may be conveniently
designated as <em>servient</em>, while the encumbrance which derogates
from it may be contrasted as <em>dominant</em>. These expressions
are derived from, and conform to, Roman usage in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>matter of servitudes. The general and subordinate right
was spoken of figuratively by the Roman lawyers as being in
bondage to the special right which prevailed over and derogated
from it. The term <i><span lang="la">servitus</span></i>, thus derived, came to
denote the superior right itself rather than the relation
between it and the other; just as <i><span lang="la">obligatio</span></i> came to denote
the right of the creditor, rather than the bond of legal subjection
under which the debtor lay.<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c016'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The terms <i><span lang="la">jus in re propria</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">jus in re aliena</span></i> were
devised by the commentators on the civil law, and are not
to be found in the original sources. Their significance is
clear. The owner of a chattel has <i><span lang="la">jus in re propria</span></i>—a right
over his own property; the pledgee or other encumbrancer
of it has <i><span lang="la">jus in re aliena</span></i>—a right over the property of some
one else.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is nothing to prevent one encumbrance from being
itself subject to another. Thus a tenant may sublet; that
is to say, he may grant a lease of his lease, and so confer
upon the sub-lessee a <i><span lang="la">jus in re aliena</span></i> of which the immediate
subject-matter is itself merely another right of the same
quality. The right of the tenant in such a case is dominant
with regard to that of the landowner, but servient with
regard to that of the sub-lessee. So the mortgagee of land
may grant a mortgage of his mortgage; that is to say, he
may create what is called a sub-mortgage. The mortgage
will then be a dominant right in respect of the ownership of
the land, but a servient right with respect to the sub-mortgage.
So the easements appurtenant to land are leased
or mortgaged along with it; and therefore, though themselves
encumbrances, they are themselves encumbered.
Such a series of rights, each limiting and derogating from the
one before it, may in theory extend to any length.</p>

<p class='c007'>A right is not to be classed as encumbered or servient,
merely on account of its <em>natural</em> limits and restrictions.
Otherwise all rights would fall within this category, since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>none of them are unlimited in their scope, all being restrained
within definite boundaries by the conflicting interests and
rights of other persons. All ownership of material things,
for example, is limited by the maxim, <i><span lang="la">sic utere tuo ut alienum
non laedas</span></i>. Every man must so restrain himself in the use
of his property, as not to infringe upon the property and
rights of others. The law confers no property in stones,
sufficiently absolute and unlimited to justify their owner in
throwing them through his neighbour’s windows. No landowner
may by reason of his ownership inflict a nuisance upon
the public or upon adjoining proprietors. But in these and
all similar cases we are dealing merely with the normal and
natural boundaries of the right, not with those exceptional
and artificial restrictions which are due to the existence of
<i><span lang="la">jura in re aliena</span></i> vested in other persons. A servient right is
not merely a limited right, for all are limited; it is a right so
limited that its ordinary boundaries are infringed. It is a
right which, owing to the influence of some other and superior
right, is prevented from attaining its normal scope and
dimensions. Until we have first settled the natural contents
and limits of a right, there can be no talk of other rights
which qualify and derogate from it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is essential to an encumbrance, that it should, in the
technical language of our law, <em>run with</em> the right encumbered
by it. In other words the dominant and the servient rights
are necessarily <em>concurrent</em>. By this it is meant that an
encumbrance must follow the encumbered right into the
hands of new owners, so that a change of ownership will not
free the right from the burden imposed upon it. If this is
not so—if the right is transferable free from the burden—there
is no true encumbrance. For the burden is then
merely personal to him who is subject to it, and does not in
truth limit or derogate from the right itself. This right still
exists in its full compass, since it can be transferred in its
entirety to a new owner. For this reason an agreement to
sell land vests an encumbrance or <i><span lang="la">jus in re aliena</span></i> in the
purchaser; but an agreement to sell a chattel does not.
The former agreement runs with the property, while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>latter is non-concurrent. So the fee simple of land may be
encumbered by negative agreements, such as a covenant not
to build; for speaking generally, such obligations will run
with the land into the hands of successive owners. But
positive covenants are merely personal to the covenantor,
and derogate in no way from the fee simple vested in him,
which he can convey to another free from any such
burdens.</p>

<p class='c007'>Concurrence, however, may exist in different degrees; it
may be more or less perfect or absolute. The encumbrance
may run with the servient right into the hands of some of
the successive owners and not into the hands of others. In
particular, encumbrances may be concurrent either in law or
merely in equity. In the latter case the concurrence is
imperfect or partial, since it does not prevail against the
kind of owner known in the language of the law as a purchaser
for value without notice of the dominant right. Examples
of encumbrances running with then servient rights at
law are easements, leases, and legal mortgages. On the
other hand an agreement for a lease, an equitable mortgage,
a restrictive covenant as to the use of land, and a trust will
run with their respective servient rights in equity but not
at law.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be carefully noted that the distinction between
<i><span lang="la">jura in re propria</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">jura in re aliena</span></i> is not confined to the
sphere of real rights or <i><span lang="la">jura in rem</span></i>. Personal, no less than
real rights may be encumbrances of other rights. Personal,
no less than real rights may be themselves encumbered. A
debtor, for example, may grant a security over the book
debts owing to him in his business or over his shares in a
company, as well as over his stock in trade. A life tenancy
of money in the public funds is just as possible as a life
tenancy of land. There can be a lien over a man’s share in
a trust fund, as well as over a chattel belonging to him.
The true test of an encumbrance is not whether the encumbrancer
has a <i><span lang="la">jus in rem</span></i> available against all the world, but
whether he has a right which will avail against subsequent
owners of the encumbered property.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>The chief classes of encumbrances are four in number, namely, Leases,
Servitudes, Securities, and Trusts. In a later chapter we shall consider
these more at length, and in the meantime it is sufficient briefly to indicate
their nature.</p>

<p class='c019'>1. A lease is the encumbrance of property vested in one man by a right
to the possession and use of it vested in another.</p>

<p class='c019'>2. A servitude is a right to the limited use of a piece of land unaccompanied
either by the ownership or by the possession of it; for example, a
right of way or a right to the passage of light or water across adjoining land.</p>

<p class='c019'>3. A security is an encumbrance vested in a creditor over the property
of his debtor, for the purpose of securing the recovery of the debt; a
right, for example, to retain possession of a chattel until the debt is paid.</p>

<p class='c019'>4. A trust is an encumbrance in which the ownership of property is
limited by an equitable obligation to deal with it for the benefit of someone
else. The owner of the encumbered property is the trustee; the owner of
the encumbrance is the beneficiary.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 84. <b>Principal and Accessory Rights.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The relation between principal and accessory rights is the
reverse of that just considered as existing between servient
and dominant rights. For every right is capable of being
affected to any extent by the existence of other rights; and
the influence thus exercised by one upon another is of two
kinds, being either adverse or beneficial. It is adverse, when
one right is limited or qualified by another vested in a
different owner. This is the case already dealt with by us.
It is beneficial, on the other hand, when one right has added
to it a supplementary right vested in the same owner. In
this case the right so augmented may be termed the <em>principal</em>,
while the one so appurtenant to it is the <em>accessory</em> right. Thus
a security is accessory to the right secured; a servitude is
accessory to the ownership of the land for whose benefit it
exists; the rent and covenants of a lease are accessory to
the landlord’s ownership of the property; covenants for title
in a conveyance are accessory to the estate conveyed; and a
right of action is accessory to the right for whose enforcement
it is provided.</p>

<p class='c007'>A real right may be accessory to a personal; as in the case
of a debt secured by a mortgage of land. A personal right
may be accessory to a real; as in the case of the covenants
of a lease. A real right may be accessory to a real; as in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>the case of servitudes appurtenant to land. And finally a
personal right may be accessory to a personal; as in the case
of a debt secured by a guarantee.</p>

<p class='c007'>A right which is dominant with respect to one right, is
often at the same time accessory with respect to another. It
limits one right, and at the same time augments another.
A typical example is a servitude over land. The owner of
Whiteacre has a right of way over the adjoining farm Blackacre
to the highway. This right of way is dominant with
respect to Blackacre, and accessory with respect to Whiteacre.
For the burden of it goes with Blackacre, and the benefit
of it with Whiteacre. Blackacre is accordingly called the
servient, and Whiteacre the dominant tenement. So a mortgage
is a dominant right with respect to the property subject
to it, and an accessory right with respect to the debt secured
by it. In like manner a landlord’s right to his rent is dominant
with regard to the lease, but accessory with regard to the
reversion. This double character, however, is not necessary
or universal. A public right of way is an encumbrance of the
land subject to it, but it is not accessory to any other land.
So a lease is a dominant right which is not at the same time
accessory to any principal.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 85. <b>Legal and Equitable Rights.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>In a former chapter we considered the distinction between
common law and equity. We saw that these two systems of
law, administered respectively in the courts of common law
and the Court of Chancery, were to a considerable extent
discordant. One of the results of this discordance was the
establishment of a distinction between two classes of rights,
distinguishable as legal and equitable. Legal rights are
those which were recognised by the courts of common law.
Equitable rights (otherwise called equities) are those which
were recognised solely in the Court of Chancery. Notwithstanding
the fusion of law and equity by the Judicature Act,
1873, this distinction still exists, and must be reckoned
with as an inherent part of our legal system. That which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>would have been merely an equitable right before the
Judicature Act is merely an equitable right still.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inasmuch as all rights, whether legal or equitable, now
obtain legal recognition in all courts, it may be suggested
that the distinction is now of no importance. This is not so
however, for in two respects at least, these two classes of
rights differ in their practical effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The methods of their creation and disposition are
different. A legal mortgage of land must be created by deed,
but an equitable mortgage may be created by a written
agreement or by a mere deposit of title-deeds. A similar
distinction exists between a legal and an equitable lease, a
legal and an equitable servitude, a legal and an equitable
charge on land, and so on.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Equitable rights have a more precarious existence than
legal rights. Where there are two inconsistent legal rights
claimed adversely by different persons over the same thing,
the first in time prevails. <i><span lang="la">Qui prior est tempore potior est jure.</span></i>
A similar rule applies to the competition of two inconsistent
equitable rights. But when a legal and an equitable right
conflict, the legal will prevail over and destroy the equitable,
even though subsequent to it in origin, provided that the
owner of the legal right acquired it for value and without
notice of the prior equity. As between a prior equitable
mortgage, for example, and a subsequent legal mortgage,
preference will be given to the latter. The maxim is: Where
there are equal equities, the law will prevail. This liability
to destruction by conflict with a subsequent legal right is an
essential feature and a characteristic defect of all rights
which are merely equitable.<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c016'><sup>[202]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='c013'>OWNERSHIP.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 86. <b>The Definition of Ownership.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Ownership, in its most comprehensive signification, denotes
the relation between a person and any right that is vested
in him. That which a man owns is in all cases a right.
When, as is often the case, we speak of the ownership of a
material object, this is merely a convenient figure of speech.
To own a piece of land means in truth to own a particular
kind of right in the land, namely, the fee simple of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ownership, in this generic sense, extends to all classes of
rights, whether proprietary or personal, <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i> or <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>,
<i><span lang="la">in re propria</span></i> or <i><span lang="la">in re aliena</span></i>. I may own a debt, or a mortgage,
or a share in a company, or money in the public funds,
or a copyright, or a lease, or a right of way, or the fee simple
of land. Every right is owned; and nothing can be owned
except a right. Every man is the owner of the rights which
are his.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ownership, in its generic sense, as the relation in which a
person stands to any right vested in him, is opposed to two
other possible relations between a person and a right. It is
opposed in the first place to possession. This very difficult
juridical conception will be considered by us in the succeeding
chapter. We shall see that the possession of a right (<i><span lang="la">possessio
juris, Rechtsbesitz</span></i>) is the <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> relation of continuing
exercise and enjoyment, as opposed to the <i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i> relation of
ownership. A man may possess a right without owning it, as
where the wrongful occupant of land makes use of a right of
way or other casement appurtenant to it. Or he may own a
right without possessing it. Or finally ownership and possession
may be united, as indeed they usually are, the <i><span lang="la">de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>jure</span></i> and the <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> relations being coexistent and
coincident.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ownership of a right is, in the second place, opposed to
the encumbrance of it. The owner of the right is he in
whom the right itself is vested; while the encumbrancer of
it is he in whom is vested, not the right itself, but some
adverse, dominant, and limiting right in respect of it. A.
may be the owner of property, B. the lessee of it, C. the sub-lessee,
D. the first mortgagee, E. the second mortgagee, and
so on indefinitely. Legal nomenclature, however, does not
supply separate names for every distinct kind of encumbrancer.
There is no distinctive title, for example, by which
we may distinguish from the owner of the property him who
has an easement over it or the benefit of a covenant which
runs with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although encumbrance is thus opposed to ownership,
every encumbrancer is nevertheless himself the <em>owner</em> of the
encumbrance. The mortgagee of the land is the owner of
the mortgage. The lessee of the land is the owner of the
lease. The mortgagee of the mortgage is the owner of the
sub-mortgage. That is to say, he in whom an encumbrance
is vested stands in a definite relation not merely to it, but
also to the right encumbered by it. Considered in relation
to the latter, he is an encumbrancer; but considered in
relation to the former, he is himself an owner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ownership is of various kinds, and the following distinctions
are of sufficient importance and interest to deserve
special examination:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Corporeal and Incorporeal Ownership.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Sole Ownership and Co-ownership.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Trust-Ownership and Beneficial Ownership.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Legal and Equitable Ownership.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Vested and Contingent Ownership.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 87. <b>Corporeal and Incorporeal Ownership.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Although the true subject-matter of ownership is in all
cases a right, a very common form of speech enables us to
speak of the ownership of material things. We speak of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>owning, acquiring, or transferring, not rights in land or
chattels, but the land or chattels themselves. That is to
say, we identify by way of metonymy the right with the
material thing which is its object. This figure of speech is
no less convenient than familiar. The concrete reference to
the material object relieves us from the strain of abstract
thought. Rights are dim abstractions, while material things
are visible realities; and it is easier to think and speak of the
latter than of the former, even though the substitution is a
mere figure of speech. This device, moreover, is an aid to
brevity, no less than to ease of comprehension.</p>

<p class='c007'>This figurative identification of a right with its object is,
however, not always permissible. I may be said to own the
money in my hand; but as to that which is due to me, I own
not the money, but a right to it. In the one case I own the
material coins; in the other the immaterial debt or <em>chose in
action</em>. So I own my land, but merely a right of way over
the land of my neighbour. If we look, therefore, no deeper
than the mere usages of speech, it would seem as if the
subject-matter of ownership were sometimes a material object
and at other times a right. This, of course, would be a logical
absurdity. Ownership may conceivably be in all cases a
relation to a material object; or it may in all cases be a
relation to a right; but it cannot be sometimes the one
and sometimes the other. So long as we remember that the
ownership of a material thing is nothing more than a figurative
substitute for the ownership of a particular kind of right
in that thing, the usage is one of great convenience; but so
soon as we attempt to treat it as anything more than a figure
of speech, it becomes a fertile source of confusion of thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what cases, then, do we use this figure of speech? What
is it that determines whether we do or do not identify a right
with its object? How is the line drawn between corporeal
and incorporeal ownership? The usage is to some extent
arbitrary and uncertain. The application of figurative
language is a matter not of logic but of variable practice and
opinion. Speaking generally, however, we may say that the
ownership of a material thing means the ownership of a <i><span lang="la">jus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>in re propria</span></i> in respect of that thing. No man is said to
own a piece of land or a chattel, if his right over it is merely
an encumbrance of some more general right vested in some
one else. The ownership of a <i><span lang="la">jus in re aliena</span></i> is always
incorporeal, even though the object of that right is a corporeal
thing. I am not said to own a chattel, merely because I
own a right to have it transferred to me, or because I own
a lien over it or a right to the temporary use of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>When, on the other hand, a right is not a mere encumbrance
of another right—when it is a self-existent <i><span lang="la">jus in re
propria</span></i>—it is identified with the material thing which is its
subject-matter. It is not difficult to perceive the origin and
reason of this usage of speech. In its full and normal compass
a <i><span lang="la">jus in re propria</span></i> over a material object is a right to the
entirety of the lawful uses of that object. It is a general
right of use and disposal, all <i><span lang="la">jura in re aliena</span></i> being merely
special and limited rights derogating from it in special
respects. It is only this absolute and comprehensive right—this
<i><span lang="la">universum jus</span></i>—that is identified with its object. For it
is in some sense coincident with its object, and exhausts the
juridical significance of it. It is the greatest right which can
exist in respect of the thing, including all lesser rights within
itself, and he who owns it may therefore conveniently be said
to own the thing itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have said that in its full and normal compass corporeal
ownership is the ownership of a right to the entirety of the
lawful uses of a corporeal thing. This compass, however,
may be limited to any extent by the adverse influences of <i><span lang="la">jura
in re aliena</span></i> vested in other persons. The right of the owner
of a thing may be all but eaten up by the dominant rights of
lessees, mortgagees, and other encumbrancers. His ownership
may be reduced to a mere name rather than a reality.
Yet he none the less remains the owner of the thing, while all
others own nothing more than <em>rights</em> over it. For he still
owns that <i><span lang="la">jus in re propria</span></i> which, were all encumbrances
removed from it, would straightway expand to its normal
dimensions as the <i><span lang="la">universum jus</span></i> of general and permanent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>use. He then, is the owner of a material object, who owns
a right to the general or residuary uses of it,<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c016'><sup>[203]</sup></a> after the deduction
of all special and limited rights of use vested by way of
encumbrance in other persons.<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c016'><sup>[204]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>What, then, is the name of the right which we thus
identify, for convenience of speech, with its material object?
What shall we call the right which enables the owner of it to
say that he owns a piece of land or a chattel? Unfortunately
for the lucidity of legal nomenclature, there is, unless we are
prepared to use the somewhat awkward Latin term <i><span lang="la">jus in re
propria</span></i>, no other name for it than <em>ownership</em> itself. This is
a use of the term which is quite different from that hitherto
considered by us. Ownership, as a particular kind of right,
must be clearly distinguished from ownership, as a particular
kind of relation to rights of all descriptions. We cannot class
together the right of ownership and the ownership of a right.
This use of the term to denote a right is the natural outcome
of the figurative use of it already considered. When we not
only speak of the ownership of land, but interpret such
language literally, it is clear that ownership must be taken
as the name of the right which the owner has in the land.<a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c016'><sup>[205]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ 88. <b>Corporeal and Incorporeal Things.</b></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Closely connected with the distinction between corporeal
and incorporeal ownership is that between corporeal and
incorporeal <em>things</em>. The term thing (<i><span lang="la">res</span></i>, <em>chose</em>, <em>sache</em>) is used
in three distinct senses by legal writers:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. In its first and simplest application it means merely a
material object, regarded as the subject-matter of a right.<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c016'><sup>[206]</sup></a>
According to this use, some rights are rights to or over
things, and some are not. The owner of a house owns a
thing; the owner of a patent does not.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. In a second and wider sense the term thing includes
every subject-matter of a right, whether a material object or
not. In this signification every right is a right in or to some
thing. A man’s life, reputation, health, and liberty are things
in law, no less than are his land and chattels.<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c016'><sup>[207]</sup></a> Things in
this sense are either material or immaterial, but the distinction
thus indicated must not be confounded with that now
to be explained between things corporeal and incorporeal.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. In a third and last application the term thing means
whatever a man owns as part of his estate or property. It is
any subject-matter of ownership within the sphere of proprietary
or valuable rights. Now we have already seen that
according to the current usage of figurative speech ownership
is sometimes that of a material object and sometimes that of
a right. Things, therefore, as the objects of ownership, are of
two kinds also. A corporeal thing (<i><span lang="la">res corporalis</span></i>) is the subject-matter
of corporeal ownership; that is to say, a material
object. An incorporeal thing (<i><span lang="la">res incorporalis</span></i>) is the subject-matter
of incorporeal ownership; that is to say, it is any
proprietary right except that right of full dominion over a
material object which, as already explained, is figuratively
identified with the object itself. If I own a field and a right
of way over another, my field is a <i><span lang="la">res corporalis</span></i> and my right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>of way is a <i><span lang="la">res incorporalis</span></i>. If I own a pound in my pocket
and a right to receive another from my debtor, the first pound
is a thing corporeal, and the right to receive the second is a
thing incorporeal; it is that variety of the latter, which is
called, in the technical language of English law, a <em>chose in
action</em> or thing in action; while the pound in my pocket is a
chose or thing in possession.<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c016'><sup>[208]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is clear that if literally interpreted, this distinction is
illogical and absurd. We cannot treat in this way rights and
the objects of rights as two species of one genus. If we use
the term thing in each case to mean a right, then the right
of an owner of land is just as incorporeal as is that of his
tenant. On the other hand, if the term is to be taken in
each case to mean the object of a right, then the object of
the tenant’s right is just as corporeal as is that of his landlord.
The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal things is
based on the same figure of speech as is that between corporeal
and incorporeal ownership. Both distinctions become intelligible,
so soon as we recognise the metonymy involved in
the substitution of the subject-matter of a right for the right
itself.<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c016'><sup>[209]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 89. <b>Sole Ownership and Co-ownership.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>As a general rule a right is owned by one person only at
a time, but duplicate ownership is perfectly possible. Two or
more persons may at the same time have the same right
vested in them. This may happen in several distinct ways,
but the simplest and most obvious case is that of co-ownership.
Partners, for example, are co-owners of the chattels
which constitute their stock in trade, of the lease of the premises
on which their business is conducted, and of the debts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>owing to them by their customers. It is not correct to say
that a right owned by co-owners is divided between them,
each of them owning a separate part. The right is an undivided
unity, which is vested at the same time in more than
one person. If two partners have at their bank a credit
balance of 1000<em>l.</em>, there is one debt of 1000<em>l.</em> owing by the
bank to both of them at once, not two separate debts of 500<em>l.</em>
due to each of them individually. Each partner is entitled to
the whole sum, just as each would owe to the bank the whole
of the firm’s overdraft. The several ownership of a part is a
different thing from the co-ownership of the whole. So soon
as each of two co-owners begins to own a part of the right
instead of the whole of it, the co-ownership has been dissolved
into sole ownership by the process known as partition. Co-ownership
involves the undivided integrity of the right owned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Co-ownership, like all other forms of duplicate ownership,
is possible only so far as the law makes provision for harmonising
in some way the conflicting claims of the different
owners <i><span lang="la">inter se</span></i>. In the case of co-owners the title of the one
is rendered consistent with that of the other by the existence
of reciprocal obligations of restricted use and enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Co-ownership may assume different forms by virtue of the
different incidents attached to it by law. Its two chief kinds
in English law are distinguished as ownership <em>in common</em> and
<em>joint</em> ownership. The most important difference between
these relates to the effect of the death of one of the co-owners.
In ownership in common the right of a dead man descends to
his successors like any other inheritable right. But on the
death of one of two joint owners his ownership dies with him,
and the survivor becomes the sole owner by virtue of this
right of survivorship or <i><span lang="la">jus accrescendi</span></i>.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 90. <b>Trust and Beneficial Ownership.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>A trust is a very important and curious instance of duplicate
ownership. Trust property is that which is owned by
two persons at the same time, the relation between the two
owners being such that one of them is under an obligation to
use his ownership for the benefit of the other. The former is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>called the trustee, and his ownership is trust-ownership; the
latter is called the beneficiary, and his is beneficial ownership.<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c016'><sup>[210]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The trustee is destitute of any right of beneficial enjoyment
of the trust property. His ownership, therefore, is a matter
of form rather than of substance, and nominal rather than
real. If we have regard to the essence of the matter rather
than to the form of it, a trustee is not an owner at all, but a
mere agent, upon whom the law has conferred the power and
imposed the duty of administering the property of another
person. In legal theory, however, he is not a mere agent but
an owner. He is a person to whom the property of some one
else is fictitiously attributed by the law, to the intent that the
rights and powers thus vested in a nominal owner shall be
used by him on behalf of the real owner. As between trustee
and beneficiary, the law recognises the truth of the matter;
as between these two, the property belongs to the latter and
not to the former. But as between the trustee and third
persons, the fiction prevails. The trustee is clothed with the
rights of his beneficiary, and is so enabled to personate or
represent him in dealings with the world at large.</p>

<p class='c007'>The purpose of trusteeship is to protect the rights and
interests of persons who for any reason are unable effectively
to protect them for themselves. The law vests those rights
and interests for safe custody, as it were, in some other person
who is capable of guarding them and dealing with them, and
who is placed under a legal obligation to use them for the
benefit of him to whom they in truth belong. The chief
classes of persons in whose behalf the protection of trusteeship
is called for are four in number. In the first place, property
may belong to persons who are not yet born; and in order
that it may be adequately safeguarded and administered, it
is commonly vested in the meantime in trustees, who hold
and deal with it on account of its unborn owners. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>second place, similar protection is required for the property of
those who lie under some incapacity in respect of the administration
of it, such as infancy, lunacy, or absence. Thirdly, it
is expedient that property in which large numbers of persons
are interested in common should be vested in trustees. The
complexities and difficulties which arise from co-ownership
become so great, so soon as the number of co-owners ceases to
be small, that it is essential to avoid them; and one of the
most effective devices for this purpose is that scheme of
duplicate ownership which we term a trust. Fourthly, when
persons have conflicting interests in the same property (for
example, an owner and an encumbrancer, or different kinds
of encumbrancers) it is often advisable that the property
should be vested in trustees, whose power and duty it is to
safeguard the interests of each of those persons against the
conflicting claims of the others.</p>

<p class='c007'>A trust is to be distinguished from two other relations
which resemble it. It is to be distinguished, in the first place,
from a mere contractual obligation to deal with one’s property
on behalf of some one else. A trust is more than an obligation
to use one’s property for the benefit of another; it is an
obligation to use it for the benefit of another in whom it is
already concurrently vested. The beneficiary has more than
a mere personal right against his trustee to the performance
of the obligations of the trust. He is himself an owner of
the trust property. That which the trustee owns, the beneficiary
owns also. If the latter owned nothing save the
personal obligation between the trustee and himself, there
would be no trust at all. Thus if a husband gratuitously
covenants with his wife to settle certain property upon her,
he remains the sole owner of it, until he has actually transferred
it in fulfilment of his contract; and in the meantime
the wife owns nothing save the contractual obligation created
by the covenant. There is therefore no trust. If, on the
other hand, the husband declares himself a trustee of the
property for his wife, the effect is very different. Here also
he is under a personal obligation to transfer the property to
her, but this is not all. The beneficial ownership of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>property passes to the wife forthwith, yet the ownership
of the husband is not destroyed. It is merely transformed
into a trust-ownership consistent with the concurrent beneficial
title of his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the second place, a trust is to be distinguished from the
relation in which an agent stands towards the property which
he administers on behalf of his principal. In substance,
indeed, as already indicated, these two relations are identical,
but in form and in legal theory they are essentially different.
In agency the property is vested solely in the person on whose
behalf the agent acts, but in trusteeship it is vested in the
trustee himself, no less than in the beneficiary. A trustee
is an agent for the administration of property, who is at the
same time the nominal owner of the property so administered
by him.</p>

<p class='c019'>A trust is created by any act or event which separates the trust-ownership
of any property from the beneficial ownership of it, and vests them in
different persons. Thus the direct owner of property may declare himself
a trustee for some one else, who thereupon becomes the beneficial owner;
or the direct owner may transfer the property to some one else, to hold it
in trust for a third. Conversely, a trust is destroyed by any act or event
which reunites in the same hands the two forms of ownership which have
become thus separated. The trustee, for example, may transfer the
property to the beneficiary, who then becomes the direct owner; or the
beneficiary may transfer it to his trustee, with the like result.</p>

<p class='c019'>Trust-ownership and beneficial ownership are independent of each other
in their destination and disposition. Either of them may be transferred,
while the other remains unaffected. The trustee may assign to another,
who thereupon becomes a trustee in his stead, while the beneficiary
remains the same; or the beneficiary may assign to another, while the
trust-ownership remains where it was. In like manner, either kind of
ownership may be independently encumbered. The trustee may, in
pursuance of the powers of the trust, lease or mortgage the property without
the concurrence of the beneficiary; and the beneficiary may deal in the
same way with his beneficial ownership independently of the trustee.</p>

<p class='c019'>Whenever the beneficial ownership has been encumbered, either by
the creator of the trust or by the beneficial owner himself, the trustee
holds the property not only on behalf of the beneficial owner but also on
behalf of the beneficial encumbrancers. That is to say, the relation of
trusteeship exists between the trustee and all persons beneficially interested
in the property, either as owners or encumbrancers. Thus if property is
transferred to A., in trust for B. for life, with remainder to C., A. is a
trustee not merely for C., the beneficial owner, but also for B., the beneficial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>encumbrancer. Both are beneficiaries of the trust, and between the
trustee and each of them there exists the bond of a trust-obligation.<a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c016'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 91. <b>Legal and Equitable Ownership.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Closely connected but not identical with the distinction
between trust and beneficial ownership, is that between legal
and equitable ownership. One person may be the legal and
another the equitable owner of the same thing at the same
time. Legal ownership is that which has its origin in the
rules of the common law, while equitable ownership is that
which proceeds from rules of equity divergent from the common
law. The courts of common law refused to recognise
equitable ownership, and denied that the equitable owner
was an owner at all. The Court of Chancery adopted a very
different attitude. Here the legal owner was recognised no
less than the equitable, but the former was treated as a
trustee for the latter. Chancery vindicated the prior claims
of equity, not by denying the existence of the legal owner, but
by taking from him by means of a trust the beneficial enjoyment
of his property. The fusion of law and equity effected
by the Judicature Act, 1873, has not abolished this distinction;
it has simply extended the doctrines of the Chancery
to the courts of common law, and as equitable ownership did
not extinguish or exclude legal ownership in Chancery, it
does not do so now.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distinction between legal and equitable ownership is
not identical with that mentioned in a previous chapter as
existing between legal and equitable <em>rights</em>. These two forms
of ownership would still exist even if all rights were legal.
The equitable ownership of a legal right is a different thing
from the ownership of an equitable right. Law and equity
are discordant not merely as to the <em>existence</em> of rights, but
also as to the <em>ownership</em> of the rights which they both recognise.
When a debt is verbally assigned by A. to B., A.
remains the legal owner of it none the less, but B. becomes
the equitable owner of it. But there are not for that reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span><em>two</em> debts. There is only one as before, though it has now
two owners. So if A., the legal owner of a share in a company,
makes a declaration of trust in favour of B., B. becomes
forthwith the equitable owner of the share; but it is the
same share as before, and not another. The thing which he
thus equitably owns is a legal right, which is at the same time
legally owned by A. Similarly the ownership of an equitable
mortgage is a different thing from the equitable ownership
of a legal mortgage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor is the distinction between legal and equitable ownership
merely equivalent to that between trust and beneficial
ownership. It is true that, whenever the legal estate is in
one man and the equitable estate in another, there is a trust.
A legal owner is always a trustee for the equitable owner, if
there is one. But an equitable owner may himself be merely
a trustee for another person. A man may settle upon trust
his equitable interest in a trust fund, or his equitable estate
in his mortgaged land. In such a case neither trustee nor
beneficiary will have anything more than equitable ownership.</p>

<p class='c007'>If an equitable owner can be a trustee, can a legal owner
be a beneficiary? As the law now stands, he cannot. But
this is a mere accident of historical development, due to the
fact that the courts of common law refused to recognise trusts
at all. There is no more theoretical difficulty in allowing that
a trustee and his beneficiary may both be legal owners, than
in allowing that they may both be equitable owners. Had
the courts of common law worked out a doctrine of trusts for
themselves, this twofold legal ownership would have actually
existed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The practical importance of the distinction between legal
and equitable ownership is the same as that already indicated
as pertaining to the distinction between legal and equitable
rights.<a id='r212'></a><a href='#f212' class='c016'><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 92. <b>Vested and Contingent Ownership.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Ownership is either vested or contingent. It is vested when
the owner’s title is already perfect; it is contingent when his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>title is as yet imperfect, but is capable of becoming perfect on
the fulfilment of some condition. In the former case he owns
the right absolutely; in the latter he owns it merely conditionally.
In the former case the investitive fact from which
he derives the right is complete in all its parts; in the latter
it is incomplete, by reason of the absence of some necessary
element, which is nevertheless capable of being supplied in
the future. In the meantime, therefore, his ownership is
contingent, and it will not become vested until the necessary
condition is fulfilled. A testator, for example, may leave
property to his wife for her life, and on her death to A., if he
is then alive, but if A. is then dead, to B. A. and B. are both
owners of the property in question, but their ownership is
merely contingent. That of A. is conditional on his surviving
the testator’s widow; while that of B. is conditional on the
death of A. in the widow’s lifetime.</p>

<p class='c007'>The contingent <em>ownership</em> of a right does not necessarily
involve its contingent <em>existence</em>. It need not be a contingent
right, because it is contingently owned. Shares and other
choses in action may have an absolute existence, though the
ownership of them may be contingently and alternately in A.
and B. Money in a bank may be certainly owing to some one,
though it may depend on a condition, whether it is owing to
C. or D. On the other hand, it may be that the right is contingent
in respect of its existence, no less than in respect of
its ownership. This is so whenever there is no alternative
owner, and when, therefore, the right will belong to no one
unless it becomes vested in the contingent owner by the
fulfilment of the condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be noticed that the contingent ownership of a right
is something more than a simple chance or possibility of
becoming the owner of it. It is more than a mere <i><span lang="la">spes
acquisitionis</span></i>. I have no contingent ownership of a piece of
land merely because I may buy it, if I so wish; or because
peradventure its owner may leave it to me by his will. Contingent
ownership is based not upon the mere possibility of
future acquisition, but upon the present existence of an
inchoate or incomplete title.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>The conditions on which contingent ownership depends are
termed conditions <em>precedent</em> to distinguish them from another
kind known as conditions <em>subsequent</em>. A condition precedent
is one by the fulfilment of which an inchoate title is completed;
a condition subsequent is one on the fulfilment of
which a title already completed is extinguished. In the
former case I acquire absolutely what I have already acquired
conditionally. In the latter case I lose absolutely
what I have already lost conditionally. A condition precedent
involves an inchoate or incomplete investitive fact; a
condition subsequent involves an incomplete or inchoate
divestitive fact.<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c016'><sup>[213]</sup></a> He who owns property subject to a power
of sale or power of appointment vested in some one else, owns
it subject to a condition subsequent. His title is complete,
but there is already in existence an incomplete divestitive
fact, which may one day complete itself and cut short his
ownership.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be noticed that ownership subject to a condition
subsequent is not contingent but vested. The condition is
attached not to the commencement of vested ownership, but
to the continuance of it. Contingent ownership is that which
is not yet vested, but may become so in the future; while
ownership subject to a condition subsequent is already
vested, but may be divested and destroyed in the future. In
other words ownership subject to a condition subsequent is
not contingent but determinable. It is ownership already
vested, but liable to premature determination by the completion
of a divestitive fact which is already present in part.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is clear that two persons may be contingent owners of
the same right at the same time. The ownership of each is
alternative to that of the other. The ownership of one is
destined to become vested, while that of the other is appointed
to destruction. Similarly the vested ownership of
one man may coexist with the contingent ownership of
another. For the event which in the future will vest the
right in the one, will at the same time divest it from the other.
Thus a testator may leave property to his wife, with a provision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>that if she marries again, she shall forfeit it in favour of
his children. His widow will have the vested ownership of
the property, and his children the contingent ownership at
the same time. Her marriage is a condition subsequent in
respect of her own vested ownership, and a condition precedent
in respect of the contingent ownership of the children.<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c016'><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 93. <b>Introduction.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>In the whole range of legal theory there is no conception
more difficult than that of possession. The Roman lawyers
brought their usual acumen to the analysis of it, and since
their day the problem has formed the subject of a voluminous
literature, while it still continues to tax the ingenuity of
jurists. Nor is the question one of mere curiosity or scientific
interest, for its practical importance is not less than its difficulty.
The legal consequences which flow from the acquisition
and loss of possession are many and serious. Possession,
for example, is evidence of ownership; the possessor of a
thing is presumed to be the owner of it, and may put all
other claimants to proof of their title. Long possession is a
sufficient title even to property which originally belonged
to another. The transfer of possession is one of the chief
methods of transferring ownership. The first possession of
a thing which as yet belongs to no one is a good title of right.
Even in respect of property already owned, the wrongful possession
of it is a good title for the wrongdoer, as against
all the world except the true owner. Possession is of such
efficacy, also, that a possessor may in many cases confer a
good title on another, even though he has none himself; as
when I obtain a bank-note from a thief, or goods from
a factor who disposes of them in fraud of his principal.
These are some, though some only, of the results which
the law attributes to possession, rightful or wrongful. They
are sufficient to show the importance of this conception, and
the necessity of an adequate analysis of its essential nature.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ 94. <b>Possession in Fact and in Law.</b></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>It is necessary to bear in mind from the outset the distinction
between possession in fact and possession in law. We
have to remember the possibility of more or less serious
divergences between legal principles and the truth of things.
Not everything which is recognised as possession by the law
need be such in truth and in fact. And conversely the law,
by reasons good or bad, may be moved to exclude from the
limits of the conception facts which rightly fall within them.
There are three possible cases in this respect. First, possession
may and usually does exist both in fact and in law. The
law recognises as possession all that is such in fact, and
nothing that is not such in fact, unless there is some special
reason to the contrary. Secondly, possession may exist in
fact but not in law. Thus the possession by a servant of his
master’s property is for some purposes not recognised as such
by the law, and he is then said to have detention or custody
rather than possession. Thirdly, possession may exist in law
but not in fact; that is to say, for some special reason the
law attributes the advantages and results of possession to
some one who as a matter of fact does not possess. The
possession thus fictitiously attributed to him is by English
lawyers termed <em>constructive</em>. The Roman lawyers distinguished
possession in fact as <i><span lang="la">possessio naturalis</span></i>, and possession
in law as <i><span lang="la">possessio civilis</span></i>.<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c016'><sup>[215]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of this divergence, partly intentional and
avowed, partly accidental and unavowed, between the law
and the fact of possession, it is impossible that any abstract
theory should completely harmonise with the detailed rules
to be found in any concrete body of law. Such harmony
would be possible only in a legal system which had developed
with absolute logical rigour, undisturbed by historical accidents,
and unaffected by any of those special considerations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>which in all parts of the law prevent the inflexible and consistent
recognition of general principles.</p>

<p class='c007'>It follows from this discordance between law and fact, that
a complete theory of possession falls into two parts: first an
analysis of the conception itself, and secondly an exposition
of the manner in which it is recognised and applied in the
actual legal system. It is with the first of those matters
that we are here alone concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be noticed that there are not two <em>ideas</em> of possession—a
legal and a natural. Were this so, we could dispense
altogether with the discussion of possession in fact. There is
only one idea, to which the actual rules of law do more or
less imperfectly conform. There is no conception which will
include all that amounts to possession in law, and will include
nothing else, and it is impossible to frame any definition from
which the concrete law of possession can be logically deduced.
Our task is merely to search for the idea which underlies
this body of rules, and of which they are the imperfect and
partial expression and application.</p>

<p class='c019'>The complexities of the English law are increased by the curious circumstance
that two distinct kinds of legal possession are recognised in that
system. These are distinguished as seisin and possession. To a considerable
extent they are governed by different rules and have different
effects. I may have seisin of a piece of land but not possession of it, or
possession but not seisin, or both at once; and in all those cases I may or
may not at the same time have possession in fact. The doctrine of seisin
is limited to land; it is one of the curiosities of that most curious of the
products of the human intellect, the English law of real property. The
doctrine of possession, on the other hand, is common, with certain variations,
to land and chattels. The divergence between these two forms of possession
in law is a matter of legal history, not of legal theory.</p>

<p class='c020'>Extraordinary importance was until a comparatively recent period
attributed by our law to the acquisition and retention of seisin by the
owner of land. Without seisin his right was a mere shadow of ownership,
rather than the full reality of it. For many purposes a man had
only what he possessed—and the form of his possession must be that which
amounted to seisin. A dispossessed owner was deprived of his most
effective remedies; he could neither alienate his estate, nor leave it by his
will; neither did his heirs inherit it after him. The tendency of modern
law is to eliminate the whole doctrine of seisin, as an archaic survival of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>an earlier process of thought, and to recognise a single form of legal
possession.<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c016'><sup>[216]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 95. <b>Corporeal and Incorporeal Possession.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We have seen in a former chapter that ownership is of
two kinds, being either corporeal or incorporeal. A similar
distinction is to be drawn in the case of possession. Corporeal
possession is the possession of a material object—a
house, a farm, a piece of money. Incorporeal possession is
the possession of anything other than a material object—for
example, a way over another man’s land, the access of light
to the windows of a house, a title of rank, an office of profit,
and such like. All these things may be possessed as well
as owned. The possessor may or may not be the owner of
them, and the owner of them may or may not be in possession
of them. They may have no owner at all, having no
existence <i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i>, and yet they may be possessed and enjoyed
<i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Corporeal possession is termed in Roman law <i><span lang="la">possessio
corporis</span></i>. Incorporeal possession is distinguished as <i><span lang="la">possessio
juris</span></i>, the possession of a right, just as incorporeal ownership
is the ownership of a right. The Germans distinguish in
like fashion between <i><span lang="de">Sachenbesitz</span></i>, the possession of a material
thing, and <i><span lang="de">Rechtsbesitz</span></i>, the possession of a right. The
significance of this nomenclature and the nature of the
distinction indicated by it will be considered by us later.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a question much debated whether incorporeal
possession is in reality true possession at all. Some are of
opinion that all genuine possession is corporeal, and that
the other is related to it by way of analogy merely. They
maintain that there is no single generic conception which
includes <i><span lang="la">possessio corporis</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">possessio juris</span></i> as its two specific
forms. The Roman lawyers speak with hesitation and even
inconsistency on the point. They sometimes include both
forms under the title of <i><span lang="la">possessio</span></i>, while at other times they
are careful to qualify incorporeal possession as <i><span lang="la">quasi possessio</span></i>—something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>which is not true possession, but is analogous
to it. The question is one of no little difficulty, but the
opinion here accepted is that the two forms do in truth
belong to a single genus. The true idea of possession is
wider than that of corporeal possession, just as the true idea
of ownership is wider than that of corporeal ownership. The
possession of a right of way is generically identical with the
possession of the land itself, though specifically different
from it.</p>

<p class='c007'>This being so, the strictly logical order of exposition
involves the analysis, in the first place, of the generic
conception, in its full compass, followed by an explanation
of the <em>differentia</em>, which distinguishes <i><span lang="la">possessio corporis</span></i> from
<i><span lang="la">possessio juris</span></i>. We shall, however, adopt a different course,
confining our attention in the first place to <i><span lang="la">possessio corporis</span></i>,
and proceeding thereafter to the analysis of <i><span lang="la">possessio juris</span></i> and
to the exposition of the generic idea which comprises both
of them. This course is advisable for two reasons. In the
first place, the matter is of such difficulty that it is easier to
proceed from the specific idea to the generic, than conversely.
And in the second place, the conception of corporeal
possession is so much more important than that of incorporeal,
that it is permissible to treat the latter simply as
a supplement to the former, rather than as co-ordinate
with it.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 96. <b>Corporeal Possession.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Corporeal possession is clearly some form of continuing
relation between a person and a material object. It is
equally clear that it is a relation of fact and not one of
right. It may be, and commonly is, a title of right; but it
is not a right itself. A man may possess a thing in defiance
of the law, no less than in accordance with it. Nor is this
in any way inconsistent with the proposition, already considered
by us, that possession may be such either in law
or in fact. A thief has possession in law, although he has
acquired it contrary to law. The law condemns his possession
as wrongful, but at the same time recognises that it exists,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>and attributes to it most, if not all, of the ordinary consequences
of possession.<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c016'><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>What, then, is the exact nature of that continuing <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i>
relation between a person and a thing, which is known as
possession? The answer is apparently this: <em>The possession
of a material object is the continuing exercise of a claim to the
exclusive use of it</em>. It involves, therefore, two distinct
elements, one of which is mental or subjective, the other
physical or objective. The one consists in the intention of
the possessor with respect to the thing possessed, while the
other consists in the external facts in which this intention has
realised, embodied, or fulfilled itself. These two constituent
elements of possession were distinguished by the Roman
lawyers as <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i>, and the expressions are conveniently
retained by modern writers. The subjective element
is called more particularly the <i><span lang="la">animus possidendi</span></i>,
<i><span lang="la">animus sibi habendi</span></i>, or <i><span lang="la">animus domini</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><span lang="la">Apiscimur possessionem</span></i>, so runs a celebrated sentence of
the Roman lawyer Paul,<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c016'><sup>[218]</sup></a> <i><span lang="la">corpore et animo, neque per se animo
aut per se corpore</span></i>. Neither of these is sufficient by itself.
Possession begins only with their union, and lasts only until
one or other of them disappears. No claim or <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i>,
however strenuous or however rightful, will enable a man
to acquire or retain possession, unless it is effectually realised
or exercised in fact. No mere intent to appropriate a thing
will amount to the possession of it. Conversely, the <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i>
without the <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i> is equally ineffective. No mere physical
relation of person to thing has any significance in this
respect, unless it is the outward form in which the needful
<i><span lang="la">animus</span></i> or intent has fulfilled and realised itself. A man
does not possess a field because he is walking about in it,
unless he has the intent to exclude other persons from the
use of it. I may be alone in a room with money that does
not belong to me lying ready to my hand on the table. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>have absolute physical power over this money; I can take
it away with me if I please; but I have no possession of it,
for I have no such purpose with respect to it.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 97. <b>The Animus Possidendi.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We shall consider separately these two elements in the
conception. And first of the <i><span lang="la">animus possidendi</span></i>. The intent
necessary to constitute possession is the intent to appropriate
to oneself the exclusive use of the thing possessed.
It is an exclusive claim to a material object. It is a purpose
of using the thing oneself and of excluding the interference
of other persons. As to this necessary mental attitude of
the possessor there are the following observations to be
made.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The <i><span lang="la">animus sibi habendi</span></i> is not necessarily a claim of
right. It may be consciously wrongful. The thief has a
possession no less real than that of a true owner. The
possessor of a thing is not he who has, or believes that he
has, a right to it, but he who intends to act as if he had
such a right. To possession in good faith the law may and
does allow special benefits which are cut off by fraud, but to
possession as such—the fulfilment of the self-assertive will of
the individual—good faith is irrelevant.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The claim of the possessor must be exclusive. Possession
involves an intent to exclude other persons from the
uses of the thing possessed. A mere intent or claim of
unexclusive use cannot amount to possession of the material
thing itself, though it may and often does amount to some
form of incorporeal possession. He who claims and exercises
a right of way over another man’s land is in possession of
this right of way; but he is not in possession of the land
itself, for he has not the necessary <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i> of exclusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The exclusion, however, need not be absolute. I may
possess my land notwithstanding the fact that some other
person, or even the public at large, possesses a right of way
over it. For, subject to this right of way, my <i><span lang="la">animus possidendi</span></i>
is still a claim of exclusive use. I intend to exclude all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>alien interference except such as is justified by the limited
and special right of use vested in others.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The <i><span lang="la">animus possidendi</span></i> need not amount to a claim or
intent to use the thing <em>as owner</em>. A tenant, a borrower, or a
pledgee may have possession no less real than that of the
owner himself. Any degree or form of intended use, however
limited in extent or in duration, may, if exclusive for
the time being, be sufficient to constitute possession.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. The <i><span lang="la">animus possidendi</span></i> need not be a claim on one’s own
behalf. I may possess a thing either on my own account or
on account of another. A servant, agent, or trustee may
have true possession, though he claims the exclusive use of
the thing on behalf of another than himself.<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c016'><sup>[219]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>5. The <i><span lang="la">animus possidendi</span></i> need not be specific, but may be
merely general. That is to say, it does not necessarily involve
any continuous or present knowledge of the particular
thing possessed or of the possessor’s relation to it. A general
intent with respect to a class of things is sufficient (if coupled
with the necessary physical relation) to confer possession of
the individual objects belonging to that class, even though
their individual existence is unknown. Thus I possess all the
books in my library, even though I may have forgotten the
existence of many of them. So if I set nets to catch fish, I
have a general intent and claim with respect to all the fish
that come therein; and my ignorance whether there are any
there or not does in no way affect my possession of such as
are there. So I have a general purpose to possess my flocks
and herds, which is sufficient to confer possession of their
increase though unknown to me. So if I receive a letter, I
have forthwith the <i><span lang="la">animus possidendi</span></i> with respect to its
enclosure; and I do not first acquire possession of the cheque
that is inside it, when I open the envelope and see it.<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c016'><sup>[220]</sup></a> But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>if, on the other hand, I buy a cabinet believing it to be
empty, whereas it contains money hid in a secret drawer, I
do not acquire possession of the money until I actually find
it; for until then I have no <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i> with respect to it, either
general or specific.<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c016'><sup>[221]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 98. <b>The Corpus of Possession.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>To constitute possession the <i><span lang="la">animus domini</span></i> is not in itself
sufficient, but must be embodied in a <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i>. The claim of
the possessor must be effectively realised in the facts; that
is to say, it must be actually and continuously exercised.
The will is sufficient only when manifested in an appropriate
environment of fact, just as the fact is sufficient only when
it is the expression and embodiment of the required intent
and will. Possession is the effective realisation in fact of the
<i><span lang="la">animus sibi habendi</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the chief difficulties in the theory of possession is
that of determining what amounts to such effective realisation.
The true answer seems to be this: that the facts
must amount to the actual present exclusion of all alien
interference with the thing possessed, together with a
reasonably sufficient security for the exclusive use of it in
the future. Then, and then only, is the <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i> or self-assertive
will of the possessor satisfied and realised. Then,
and only then, is there a continuing <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> exercise of the
claim of exclusive use. Whether this state of facts exists
depends on two things: (1) on the relation of the possessor
to other persons, and (2) on the relation of the possessor to
the thing possessed. We shall consider these two elements
of the <i><span lang="la">corpus possessionis</span></i> separately.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 99. <b>The Relation of the Possessor to other Persons.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>So far as other persons are concerned, I am in possession
of a thing when the facts of the case are such as to create a
reasonable expectation that I will not be interfered with in
the use of it. I must have some sort of security for their
acquiescence and non-interference. “The reality,” it has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>been well said,<a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c016'><sup>[222]</sup></a> “of <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> dominion is measured in inverse
ratio to the chances of effective opposition.” A security for
enjoyment may, indeed, be of any degree of goodness or
badness, and the prospect of enjoyment may vary from a
mere chance up to moral certainty. At what point in the
scale, then, are we to draw the line? What measure of
security is required for possession? We can only answer:
Any measure which normally and reasonably satisfies the
<i><span lang="la">animus domini</span></i>. A thing is possessed, when it stands with
respect to other persons in such a position that the possessor,
having a reasonable confidence that his claim to it will be
respected, is content to leave it where it is. Such a measure
of security may be derived from many sources, of which the
following are the most important.<a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c016'><sup>[223]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>The physical power of the possessor.</em> The physical power
to exclude all alien interference (accompanied of course by
the needful intent) certainly confers possession; for it constitutes
an effective guarantee of enjoyment. If I own a purse
of money, and lock it up in a burglar-proof safe in my house,
I certainly have possession of it. I have effectively realised
my <i><span lang="la">animus possidendi</span></i>, for no one can lay a finger on the thing
without my consent, and I have full power of using it myself.
Possession thus based on physical power may be looked on
as the typical and perfect form. Many writers, however, go
so far as to consider it the only form, defining possession as
the intention, coupled with the physical power, of excluding
all other persons from the use of a material object. We
shall see reason to conclude that this is far too narrow a
view of the matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>The personal presence of the possessor.</em> This source of
security must be distinguished from that which has just been
mentioned. The two commonly coincide, indeed, but not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>necessarily. Bolts, bars, and stone walls will give me the
physical power of exclusion without any personal presence
on my part; and on the other hand there may be personal
presence without any real power of exclusion. A little child
has no physical power as against a grown man; yet it
possesses the money in its hand. A dying man may retain or
acquire possession by his personal presence, but certainly not
by any physical power left in him. The occupier of a farm
has probably no real physical power of preventing a trespass
upon it, but his personal presence may be perfectly effective
in restraining any such interference with his rights. The
respect shown to a man’s person will commonly extend to all
things claimed by him that are in his immediate presence.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>Secrecy.</em> A third source of <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> security is secrecy.
If a man will keep a thing safe from others, he may hide it;
and he will gain thereby a reasonable guarantee of enjoyment
and is just as effectively in possession of the thing, as is the
strong man armed who keeps his goods in peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>Custom.</em> Such is the tendency of mankind to acquiesce
in established usage, that we have here a further and important
source of <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> security and possession. Did I
plough and sow and reap the harvest of a field last year and
the year before? Then unless there is something to the
contrary, I may reasonably expect to do it again this year,
and I am in possession of the field.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. <em>Respect for rightful claims.</em> Possession is a matter of fact
and not a matter of right. A claim may realise itself in the
facts whether it is rightful or wrongful. Yet its rightfulness,
or rather a public conviction of its rightfulness, is an important
element in the acquisition of possession. A rightful
claim will readily obtain that general acquiescence which is
essential to <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> security, but a wrongful claim will have to
make itself good without any assistance from the law-abiding
spirit of the community. An owner will possess his property
on much easier terms than those on which a thief will possess
his plunder.<a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c016'><sup>[224]</sup></a> The two forms of security, <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>tend to coincidence. Possession tends to draw ownership
after it, and ownership attracts possession.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. <em>The manifestation of the <span lang="la">animus domini</span>.</em> An important
element in the <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> security of a claim is the visibility of
the claim. Possession essentially consists, it is true, not in
the manifestation of the <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i>, but in the realisation of it.
But a manifested intent is much more likely to obtain the
security of general acquiescence than one which has never
assumed a visible form. Hence the importance of such
circumstances as entry, apprehension, and actual use.<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c016'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>7. <em>The protection afforded by the possession of other things.</em>
The possession of a thing tends to confer possession of any
other thing that is connected with the first or accessory to it.
The possession of land confers a measure of security, which
<em>may</em> amount to possession, upon all chattels situated upon it.
The possession of a house may confer the possession of the
chattels inside it. The possession of a box or a packet may
bring with it the possession of its contents. Not necessarily,
however, in any of those cases. A man effectually gives
delivery of a load of bricks by depositing them on my land,
even in my absence; but he could not deliver a roll of bank-notes
by laying them upon my doorstep. In the former case
the position of the thing is normal and secure; in the latter it
is abnormal and insecure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding some judicial dicta to the contrary, it does
not seem to be true, either in law or in fact, that the possession
of land necessarily confers possession of all chattels that
are on or under it; or that the possession of a receptacle such
as a box, bag, or cabinet, necessarily confers possession of its
contents. Whether the possession of one thing will bring
with it the possession of another that is thus connected with
it depends upon the circumstances of the particular case. A
chattel may be upon my land, and yet I shall have no possession
of it unless the <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">corpus possessionis</span></i> both exist.
I may have no <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i>; as when my neighbour’s sheep, with
or without my knowledge, stray into my field. There may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>be no <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i>; as when I lose a jewel in my garden, and cannot
find it again. There may be neither <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i> nor <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i>; as
when, unknown to me, there is a jar of coins buried somewhere
upon my estate. So in the case of chattels, the possession of
the receptacle does not of necessity carry with it the <em>possession</em>
of its contents. As already stated, if I buy a cabinet
containing money in a secret drawer, I acquire no possession
of the money, till I actually discover it. For I have no
<i><span lang="la">animus possidendi</span></i> with respect to any such contents, but
solely with respect to the cabinet itself.</p>

<p class='c019'>That this is so in law, no less than in fact, appears from the following
cases:—</p>

<p class='c020'>In <em>Bridges</em> v. <em>Hawkesworth</em><a id='r226'></a><a href='#f226' class='c016'><sup>[226]</sup></a> a parcel of bank-notes was dropped on
the floor of the defendant’s shop, where they were found by the plaintiff,
a customer. It was held that the plaintiff had a good title to them as
against the defendant. For the plaintiff, and not the defendant, was the
first to acquire possession of them. The defendant had not the necessary
<i><span lang="la">animus</span></i>, for he did not know of their existence.</p>

<p class='c020'>In <em>R.</em> v. <em>Moore</em><a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c016'><sup>[227]</sup></a> a bank-note was dropped in the shop of the prisoner,
who on discovering it, picked it up and converted it to his own use, well
knowing that the owner could be found. It was held that he was rightly
convicted of larceny; from which it follows that he was not in possession
of the note until he actually discovered it.</p>

<p class='c020'>In <em>Merry</em> v. <em>Green</em><a id='r228'></a><a href='#f228' class='c016'><sup>[228]</sup></a> the plaintiff purchased a bureau at auction, and subsequently
discovered money in it, hidden in a secret drawer and belonging
to the vendor. The plaintiff thereupon appropriated the money; and it
was held that in doing so he committed theft, as he obtained possession of
the money not when he innocently bought the bureau, but when he fraudulently
abstracted the contents of it.</p>

<p class='c020'>In <em>Cartwright</em> v. <em>Green</em><a id='r229'></a><a href='#f229' class='c016'><sup>[229]</sup></a> a bureau was delivered for the purpose of repairs
to a carpenter, who discovered in a secret drawer money which he converted
to his own use. It was held that he committed larceny, by feloniously
taking the money into his possession.</p>

<p class='c020'>On the other hand the possession of the receptacle <em>may</em> confer possession
of the contents, even though their existence is unknown; for there
may at the time of taking the receptacle be a general intent to take its
contents also. He who steals a purse, not knowing whether there is money
in it, steals the money in it at the same time.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Thus in <cite>R.</cite> v. <cite>Mucklow</cite><a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c016'><sup>[230]</sup></a> a letter containing a bank-draft was delivered
by mistake to the prisoner, whose name was identical with that of the
person for whom the letter was intended. He received the letter innocently;
but on subsequently opening it and finding that it was not meant
for him, he appropriated the draft. It was held that he was not guilty of
larceny. For the innocent possession of the letter brought with it the
innocent possession of its contents, and no subsequent fraudulent dealing
with the thing thus innocently obtained could amount to theft.</p>

<p class='c019'>There are, however, certain cases which seem to indicate that the
possessor of land possesses whatever is in it or under it.</p>

<p class='c020'>In <cite>Elwes</cite> v. <cite>Brigg Gas Co.</cite><a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c016'><sup>[231]</sup></a> the defendant company took a lease of land
from the plaintiff for the purpose of erecting gas works, and in the process
of excavation found a prehistoric boat six feet below the surface. It was
held that the boat belonged to the landlord, and not to the tenants who
discovered it. Chitty, J., says of the plaintiff: “Being entitled to the
inheritance&#160;... and in lawful possession, he was in possession of the
ground, not merely of the surface, but of everything that lay beneath the
surface down to the centre of the earth, and consequently in possession of
the boat.... In my opinion it makes no difference in these circumstances
that the plaintiff was not aware of the existence of the boat.”</p>

<p class='c020'>So in <cite>South Staffordshire Water Co.</cite> v. <cite>Sharman</cite><a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c016'><sup>[232]</sup></a> the defendant was
employed by the plaintiff company to clean out a pond upon their land,
and in doing so he found certain gold rings at the bottom of it. It was held
that the company was in first possession of these rings, and the defendant,
therefore, had acquired no title to them.</p>

<p class='c020'>Cases such as these, however, are capable of explanation on other
grounds, and do not involve any necessary conflict either with the theory
of possession or with the cases already cited, such as <em>Bridges</em> v. <em>Hawkesworth</em>.
The general principle is that the first finder of a thing has a good
title to it against all but the true owner, even though the thing is found on
the property of another person (<cite>Armory</cite> v. <cite>Delamirie</cite>,<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c016'><sup>[233]</sup></a> <cite>Bridges</cite> v. <cite>Hawkesworth</cite>).
This principle, however, is subject to important exceptions, in
which, owing to the special circumstances of the case, the better right is in
him on whose property the thing is found. The chief of these exceptional
cases are the following:—</p>

<p class='c020'>1. When he on whose property the thing is found is already in possession
not merely of the property, but of the thing itself; as in certain circumstances,
even without specific knowledge, he undoubtedly may be.
His prior possession will then confer a better right as against the finder.
If I sell a coat in the pocket of which, unknown to me, there is a purse
which I picked up in the street, and the purchaser of the coat finds the
purse in it, it may be assumed with some confidence that I have a better
right to it than he has, though it does not belong to either of us.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>2. A second limitation of the right of a finder is that, if any one finds
a thing as the servant or agent of another, he finds it not for himself, but
for his employer. If I instruct a carpenter to break open a locked box for
me, he must give up to me whatever he finds in it. This seems a sufficient
explanation of such a case as <em>Sharland’s</em>. The rings found at the bottom of
the pond were not in the Company’s possession in fact; and it seems
contrary to other cases to hold that they were so in law. But though
Sharland was the first to obtain possession of them, he obtained it for his
employers, and could claim no title for himself.<a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c016'><sup>[234]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>3. A third case in which a finder obtains no title is that in which he
gets possession only through a trespass or other act of wrongdoing. If a
trespasser seeks and finds treasure in my land, he must give it up to me,
not because I was first in possession of it (which is not the case), but because
he cannot be suffered to retain any advantage derived from his own
wrong. This seems a sufficient explanation of <cite>Elwes</cite> v. <cite>Brigg Gas Co.</cite>
“The boat,” says Chitty, J.,<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c016'><sup>[235]</sup></a> “was embedded in the land. A mere
trespasser could not have taken possession of it; he could only have come
at it by further acts of trespass involving spoil and waste of the inheritance.”
According to the true construction of the lease the tenants, though entitled
to excavate and remove soil, were not entitled to remove anything else.
They must leave the premises as they found them, save in so far as they
were authorised to do otherwise by the terms of their lease.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 100. <b>Relation of the Possessor to the Thing Possessed.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The second element in the <i><span lang="la">corpus possessionis</span></i> is the relation
of the possessor to the thing possessed, the first being that
which we have just considered, namely, the relation of the
possessor to other persons. To constitute possession the
<i><span lang="la">animus domini</span></i> must realise itself in both of those relations.
The necessary relation between the possessor and the thing
possessed is such as to admit of his making such use of it as
accords with the nature of the thing and of his claim to it.
There must be no barrier between him and it, inconsistent
with the nature of the claim he makes to it. If I desire to
catch fish, I have no possession of them till I have them
securely in my net or on my line. Till then my <i><span lang="la">animus
domini</span></i> has not been effectively embodied in the facts. So
possession once gained may be lost by the loss of my power of
using the thing; as when a bird escapes from its cage, or I
drop a jewel in the sea. It is not necessary that there should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>be anything in the nature of physical presence or contact.
So far as the physical relation between person and thing is
concerned, I may be in possession of a piece of land at the
other side of the world. My power of using a thing is not
destroyed by my voluntary absence from it, for I can go to it
when I will.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some amount of difficulty or even uncertainty in coming
to the enjoyment of a thing is not inconsistent with the
present possession of it. My cattle have strayed, but they
will probably be found. My dog is away from home, but he
will probably return. I have mislaid a book, but it is somewhere
within my house and can be found with a little trouble.
These things, therefore, I still possess, though I cannot lay
my hands on them at will. I have with respect to them a
reasonable and confident expectation of enjoyment. But if
a wild bird escapes from its cage, or a thing is hopelessly
mislaid, whether in my house or out of it, I have lost possession
of it. Such a loss of the proper relation to the thing
itself is very often at the same time the loss of the proper
relation to other persons. Thus if I drop a shilling in the
street, I lose possession on both grounds. It is very unlikely
that I shall find it myself, and it is very likely that some
passer-by will discover and appropriate it.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 101. <b>Immediate and Mediate Possession.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>One person may possess a thing for and on account of some
one else. In such a case the latter is in possession by the
agency of him who so holds the thing on his behalf. The
possession thus held by one man through another may be
termed <em>mediate</em>, while that which is acquired or retained
directly or personally may be distinguished as <em>immediate</em> or
<em>direct</em>. If I go myself to purchase a book, I acquire direct
possession of it; but if I send my servant to buy it for me,
I acquire mediate possession of it through him, until he has
brought it to me, when my possession becomes immediate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of mediate possession there are three kinds.<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c016'><sup>[236]</sup></a> The first is
that which I acquire through an agent or servant; that is to
say through some one who holds solely on my account and
claims no interest of his own. In such a case I undoubtedly
acquire or retain possession; as, for example, when I allow
my servant to use my tools in his work, or when I send him
to buy or borrow a chattel for me, or when I deposit goods
with a warehouseman who holds them on my account, or
when I send my boots to a shoemaker to be repaired. In all
such cases, though the immediate possession is in the servant,
warehouseman, or artisan, the mediate possession is in me;
for the immediate possession is held on my account, and my
<i><span lang="la">animus domini</span></i> is therefore sufficiently realised in the facts.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>The second kind of mediate possession is that in which
the direct possession is in one who holds both on my account
and on his own, but who recognises my superior right to
obtain from him the direct possession whenever I choose to
demand it. That is to say, it is the case of a borrower,
hirer, or tenant at will. I do not lose possession of a thing
because I have lent it to some one who acknowledges my
title to it and is prepared to return it to me on demand, and
who in the meantime holds it and looks after it on my behalf.
There is no difference in this respect between entrusting a
thing to a servant or agent and entrusting it to a borrower.
Through the one, as well as through the other, I retain as
regards all other persons a due security for the use and
enjoyment of my property. I myself possess whatever is
possessed for me on those terms by another.<a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c016'><sup>[237]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There is yet a third form of mediate possession, respecting
which more doubt may exist, but which must be recognised
by sound theory as true possession. It is the case in which
the immediate possession is in a person who claims it for
himself until some time has elapsed or some condition has
been fulfilled, but who acknowledges the title of another
for whom he holds the thing, and to whom he is prepared
to deliver it when his own temporary claim has come to an
end: as for example when I lend a chattel to another for a
fixed time, or deliver it as a pledge to be returned on the
payment of a debt. Even in such a case I retain possession
of the thing, so far as third persons are concerned. The
<i><span lang="la">animus</span></i> and the <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i> are both present; the <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i>, for I
have not ceased, subject to the temporary right of another
person, to claim the exclusive use of the thing for myself;
the <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i>, inasmuch as through the instrumentality of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>bailee or pledgee, who is keeping the thing safe for me, I am
effectually excluding all other persons from it, and have
thereby attained a sufficient security for its enjoyment. In
respect of the effective realisation of the <i><span lang="la">animus domini</span></i>, there
seems to be no essential difference between entrusting a thing
to an agent, entrusting it to a bailee at will, and entrusting
it to a bailee for a fixed term, or to a creditor by way of
pledge. In all these cases I get the benefit of the immediate
possession of another person, who, subject to his own claim,
if any, holds and guards the thing on my account. If I send
a book to be bound, can my continued possession of it depend
on whether the binder has or has not a lien over it for the
price of the work done by him? If I lend a book to a friend,
can my possession of it depend on whether he is to return
it on demand or may keep it till to-morrow? Such distinctions
are irrelevant, and in any alternative my possession as
against third persons is unaffected.</p>

<p class='c019'>A test of the existence of a true mediate possession in all the foregoing
cases is to be found in the operation of the law of prescription. A title
by prescription is based on long and continuous possession. But he who
desires to acquire ownership in this way need not retain the immediate
possession of the thing. He may let his land to a tenant for a term of
years, and his possession will remain unaffected, and prescription will continue
to run in his favour. If he desires to acquire a right of way by prescription,
his tenant’s use of it is equivalent to his own. For all the purposes
of the law of prescription mediate possession in all its forms is as
good as immediate. In <em>Haig</em> v. <em>West</em><a id='r238'></a><a href='#f238' class='c016'><sup>[238]</sup></a> it is said by Lindley, L. J.: “The
vestry by their tenants occupied and enjoyed the lanes as land belonging
to the parish.... The parish have in our opinion gained a title to these
parish lanes by the Statute of Limitations. The vestry have by their
tenants occupied and enjoyed the lanes for more than a century.”</p>

<p class='c019'>In the case of chattels a further test of the legal recognition of mediate
possession in all its forms is to be found in the law as to delivery by attornment.
In <cite>Elmore</cite> v. <cite>Stone</cite><a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c016'><sup>[239]</sup></a> A. bought a horse from B., a livery stable
keeper, and at the same time agreed that it should remain at livery with
B. It was held that by this agreement the horse had been effectually
delivered by B. to A., though it had remained continuously in the physical
custody of B. That is to say, A. had acquired mediate possession, through
the direct possession which B. held on his behalf. The case of <em>Marvin</em> v.
<em>Wallace</em><a id='r240'></a><a href='#f240' class='c016'><sup>[240]</sup></a> goes still further. A. bought a horse from B., and, without any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>change in the immediate possession, lent it to the seller to keep and use as a
bailee for a month. It was held that the horse had been effectually
delivered by B. to A. This was mediate possession of the third kind,
being acquired and retained through a bailee for a fixed term. Crompton,
J., referring to <cite>Elmore</cite> v. <cite>Stone</cite>, says:<a id='r241'></a><a href='#f241' class='c016'><sup>[241]</sup></a> “In the one case we have a
bailment of a description different from the original possession; here we
have a loan; but in each case the possession of the bailee is the possession
of the bailor; it would be dangerous to distinguish between such cases.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In all cases of mediate possession two persons are in possession
of the same thing at the same time. Every mediate
possessor stands in relation to a direct possessor through
whom he holds. If I deposit goods with an agent, he is in
possession of them as well as I. He possesses for me, and I
possess through him. A similar duplicate possession exists
in the case of master and servant, landlord and tenant, bailor
and bailee, pledgor and pledgee. In all such cases, however,
there is an important distinction to be noticed. Mediate
possession exists as against third persons only, and not as
against the immediate possessor. Immediate possession, on
the other hand, is valid as against all the world, including
the mediate possessor himself. Thus if I deposit goods with
a warehouseman, I retain possession as against all other persons;
because as against them I have the benefit of the
warehouseman’s custody. But as between the warehouseman
and myself, he is in possession and not I. For as against
him I have in no way realised my <i><span lang="la">animus possidendi</span></i> nor in
any way obtained a security of use and enjoyment. So in
the case of a pledge, the debtor continues to possess quoad the
world at large; but as between debtor and creditor, possession
is in the latter. The debtor’s possession is mediate and
relative; the creditor’s is immediate and absolute. So also
with landlord and tenant, bailor and bailee, master and
servant, principal and agent, and all other cases of mediate
possession.</p>

<p class='c019'>Here also we may find a test in the operation of prescription. As
between landlord and tenant, prescription, if it runs at all, will run in
favour of the tenant; but at the same time it may run in favour of the
landlord as against the true owner of the property. Let us suppose, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>example, that possession for twenty years will in all cases give a good title
to land, and that A. takes wrongful possession of land from X., holds it for
ten years, and then allows B. to have the gratuitous use of it as tenant at
will. In ten years more A. will have a good title as against X., for, as
against him, A. has been continuously in possession. But in yet another
ten years B., the tenant, will have a good title as against his landlord A., for,
as between these two, the possession has been for twenty years in B.</p>

<p class='c019'>To put the matter in a general form, prescription runs in favour of the
immediate against the mediate possessor, but in favour of the mediate
possessor as against third persons.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 102. <b>Concurrent Possession.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>It was a maxim of the civil law that two persons could
not be in possession of the same thing at the same time.
<i><span lang="la">Plures eandem rem in solidum possidere non possunt.</span></i><a id='r242'></a><a href='#f242' class='c016'><sup>[242]</sup></a> As a
general proposition this is true; for exclusiveness is of the
essence of possession. Two adverse claims of exclusive use
cannot both be effectually realised at the same time. Claims,
however, which are not adverse, and which are not, therefore,
mutually destructive, admit of concurrent realisation.
Hence there are several possible cases of duplicate possession.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Mediate and immediate possession coexist in respect
of the same thing as already explained.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Two or more persons may possess the same thing in
common, just as they may own it in common. This is called
<i><span lang="la">compossessio</span></i> by the civilians.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Corporeal and incorporeal possession may coexist in
respect of the same material object, just as corporeal and
incorporeal ownership may. Thus A. may possess the land,
while B. possesses a right of way over it. For it is not necessary,
as we have already seen, that A.’s claim of exclusive
use should be absolute; it is sufficient that it is general.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 103. <b>The Acquisition of Possession.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Possession is acquired whenever the two elements of <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i>
and <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i> come into coexistence, and it is lost so soon as
either of them disappears. The modes of acquisition are two
in number, namely Taking and Delivery. Taking is the
acquisition of possession without the consent of the previous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>possessor. The thing taken may or may not have been
already in the possession of some one else, and in either case
the taking of it may be either rightful or wrongful. Delivery,
on the other hand, is the acquisition of possession with the
consent and co-operation of the previous possessor. It is of
two kinds, distinguished by English lawyers as actual and
constructive.<a id='r243'></a><a href='#f243' class='c016'><sup>[243]</sup></a> Actual delivery is the transfer of <em>immediate</em>
possession; it is such a physical dealing with the thing as
transfers it from the hands of one person to those of another.
It is of two kinds, according as the <em>mediate</em> possession is or
is not retained by the transferor. The delivery of a chattel
by way of sale is an example of delivery without any reservation
of mediate possession; the delivery of a chattel by way
of loan or deposit is an instance of the reservation of mediate
possession on the transfer of immediate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Constructive delivery, on the other hand, is all which is
not actual, and it is of three kinds. The first is that which
the Roman lawyers termed <i><span lang="la">traditio brevi manu</span></i>, but which has
no recognised name in the language of English law. It consists
in the surrender of the mediate possession of a thing to
him who is already in immediate possession of it. If, for
example, I lend a book to some one, and afterwards, while
he still retains it, I agree with him to sell it to him, or to
make him a present of it, I can effectually deliver it to him
in fulfilment of this sale or gift, by telling him that he may
keep it. It is not necessary for him to go through the form
of handing it back to me and receiving it a second time from
my hands. For he has already the immediate possession of
it, and all that is needed for delivery under the sale or gift
is the destruction of the <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i> through which mediate
possession is still retained by me.<a id='r244'></a><a href='#f244' class='c016'><sup>[244]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The second form of constructive delivery is that which the
commentators on the civil law have termed <i><span lang="la">constitutum possessorium</span></i>
(that is to say, an agreement touching possession).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>This is the converse of <i><span lang="la">traditio brevi manu</span></i>. It is the transfer
of mediate possession, while the immediate possession remains
in the transferor. Any thing may be effectually
delivered by means of an agreement that the possessor of it
shall for the future hold it no longer on his own account but on
account of some one else. No physical dealing with the thing
is requisite, because by the mere agreement mediate possession
is acquired by the transferee, through the immediate
possession retained by the transferor and held on the other’s
behalf. Therefore, if I buy goods from a warehouseman, they
are delivered to me so soon as he has agreed with me that he
will hold them as warehouseman on my account. The position
is then exactly the same as if I had first taken actual
delivery of them, and then brought them back to the warehouse,
and deposited them there for safe custody.<a id='r245'></a><a href='#f245' class='c016'><sup>[245]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The third form of constructive delivery is that which is
known to English lawyers as attornment.<a id='r246'></a><a href='#f246' class='c016'><sup>[246]</sup></a> This is the transfer
of mediate possession, while the immediate possession
remains outstanding in some third person. The mediate possessor
of a thing may deliver it by procuring the immediate
possessor to agree with the transferee to hold it for the future
on his account, instead of on account of the transferor. Thus
if I have goods in the warehouse of A., and sell them to B.,
I have effectually delivered them to B., so soon as A. has
agreed with B. to hold them for him, and no longer for me.
Neither in this nor in any other case of constructive delivery
is any physical dealing with the thing required, the change in
the <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i> of the persons concerned being adequate in itself.<a id='r247'></a><a href='#f247' class='c016'><sup>[247]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 104. <b>Possession not essentially the Physical Power of Exclusion.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>According to a widely accepted theory the essence of
corporeal possession is to be found in the physical power of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>exclusion. The <i><span lang="la">corpus possessionis</span></i>, it is said, is of two kinds,
according as it relates to the commencement or to the continuance
of possession. The <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i> required at the commencement
is the present or actual physical power of using the
thing oneself and of excluding all other persons from the use
of it. The <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i> required for the retention of a possession
once acquired may, on the other hand, consist merely in the
ability to reproduce this power at will. Thus I acquire possession
of a horse if I take him by the bridle, or ride upon
him, or otherwise have him in my immediate personal presence,
so that I can prevent all other persons from interfering
with him. But no such immediate physical relation is
necessary to retain the possession so acquired. I can put the
horse in my stable, or let him run in a field. So long as I can
go to him when I wish, and reproduce at will the original
relation of physical power, my possession has not ceased. To
this view of the matter, however, the following objections
may be made.<a id='r248'></a><a href='#f248' class='c016'><sup>[248]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>1. Even at the commencement a possessor need have no
physical power of excluding other persons. What physical
power of preventing trespass does a man acquire by making
an entry upon an estate which may be some square miles in
extent? Is it not clear that he may have full possession of
land that is absolutely unfenced and unprotected, lying open
to every trespasser? There is nothing to prevent even a
child from acquiring effective possession as against strong
men, nor is possession impossible on the part of him who lies
in his bed at the point of death. If I stretch a net in the sea,
do I not acquire the possession of the fish caught in it, so soon
as they are caught? Yet every other fisherman that passes
by has more power of excluding me than I have of excluding
him. So if I set traps in the forest, I possess the animals
which I catch in them, though there is neither physical presence
nor physical power. If in my absence a vendor deposits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>a load of stone or timber on my land, do I not forthwith
acquire possession of it? Yet I have no more physical power
over it than any one else has. I may be a hundred miles from
my farm, without having left any one in charge of it; but I
acquire possession of the increase of my sheep and cattle.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all such cases the assumption of physical power to exclude
alien interference is no better than a fiction. The true
test is not the physical power of preventing interference, but
the improbability of any interference, from whatever source
this improbability arises. Possession is the security of enjoyment,
and there are other means of attaining this security
than personal presence or power. It is true that in time of
war the possession of a place must be obtained and defended
by cannon and bayonets; but in the peaceful intercourse of
fellow-citizens under the rule of law, possession can be
acquired and retained on much easier terms and in much
simpler fashion. The chances of hostile interference are
determined by other considerations than that of the amount
of physical force at the disposal of the claimant. We have
to take account of the customs and opinions of the community,
the spirit of legality and of respect for rightful claims,
and the habit of acquiescence in established facts. We have
to consider the nature of the uses of which the thing admits,
the nature of the precautions which are possibly or usually
taken in respect of it, the opinion of the community as to the
rightfulness of the claim seeking to realise itself, the extent of
lawless violence that is common in the society, the opportunities
for interference and the temptations to it, and lastly
but not exclusively the physical power of the possessor to
defend himself against aggression. If, having regard to these
circumstances and to such as these, it appears that the <i><span lang="la">animus
possidendi</span></i> has so prospered as to have acquired a reasonable
security for its due fulfilment, there is true possession, and if
not, not.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. In the second place it is by no means clear how it is
possible for possession at its commencement and possession
in its continuance to be made up of different elements. How
can it be that possession at its inception involves actual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>physical power of exclusion, while in its continuance it
involves merely the power of reproducing this primary relationship?
Possession is a continuing <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> relation between
a person and a thing. Surely, therefore, it must from
beginning to end have the same essential nature. What is
that nature? Savigny’s theory affords no answer. It tells
us, at the most, how possession begins, and how it ceases; but
we wish to know what it essentially and continuously <em>is</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Thirdly and lastly, the theory which we are considering
is inapplicable to the possession of incorporeal things. Even
if it successfully explained the possession of land, it would
afford no explanation of the possession of a right of way
or other servitude. Here there is neither exclusion nor the
power of exclusion. It is, on the contrary, the possessor of
the servient land who has the physical power of excluding
the possessor of the servitude. If I possess an easement of
light, what power have I to prevent its infringement by the
building operations of my neighbour? It is true that this
is not a conclusive objection to Savigny’s analysis; for it
remains perfectly open to him to rejoin that possession in its
proper sense is limited to the possession of corporeal things,
and that its extension to incorporeal things is merely analogical
and metaphorical. The fact remains, however, that
this extension has taken place; and, other things being equal,
a definition of possession which succeeds in including both
its forms is preferable to one which is forced to reject one of
them as improper.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 105. <b>Incorporeal Possession.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Hitherto we have limited our attention to the case of corporeal
possession. We have now to consider incorporeal,
and to seek the generic conception which includes both these
forms. For I may possess not the land itself, but a way over
it, or the access of light from it, or the support afforded by
it to my land which adjoins it. So also I may possess powers,
privileges, immunities, liberties, offices, dignities, services,
monopolies. All these things may be possessed as well as
owned. They may be possessed by one man, and owned by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>another. They may be owned and not possessed, or possessed
and not owned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Corporeal possession is, as we have seen, the continuing
exercise of a claim to the exclusive use of a material object.
Incorporeal possession is the continuing exercise of a claim
to anything else. The thing so claimed may be either the
non-exclusive use of a material object (for example, a way
or other servitude over a piece of land) or some interest or
advantage unconnected with the use of material objects (for
example a trade-mark, a patent, or an office of profit).</p>

<p class='c007'>In each kind of possession there are the same two elements
required, namely the <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i> and the <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i>. The <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i> is
the claim—the self-assertive will of the possessor. The <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i>
is the environment of fact in which this claim has realised,
embodied, and fulfilled itself. Possession, whether corporeal
or incorporeal, exists only when the <i><span lang="la">animus possidendi</span></i> has
succeeded in establishing a continuing practice in conformity
to itself. Nor can any practice be said to be continuing, unless
some measure of future existence is guaranteed to it by
the facts of the case. The possession of a thing is the <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i>
condition of its continuous and secure enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of corporeal possession the <i><span lang="la">corpus possessionis</span></i>
consists, as we have seen, in nothing more than the continuing
exclusion of alien interference, coupled with ability to use
the thing oneself at will. Actual use of it is not essential. I
may lock my watch in a safe, instead of keeping it in my
pocket; and though I do not look at it for twenty years, I
remain in possession of it none the less. For I have continuously
exercised my claim to it, by continuously excluding
other persons from interference with it. In the case of incorporeal
possession, on the contrary, since there is no such
claim of exclusion, actual continuous use and enjoyment is
essential, as being the only possible mode of exercise. I can
acquire and retain possession of a right of way only through
actual and repeated use of it. In the case of incorporeal
things continuing non-use is inconsistent with possession,
though in the case of corporeal things it is consistent with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Incorporeal possession is commonly called the possession
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>of a <em>right</em>, and corporeal possession is distinguished from it
as the possession of a <em>thing</em>. The Roman lawyers distinguish
between <i><span lang="la">possessio juris</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">possessio corporis</span></i>, and the Germans
between <i><span lang="de">Rechtsbesitz</span></i> and <i><span lang="de">Sachenbesitz</span></i>. Adopting this
nomenclature, we may define incorporeal possession as the
continuing exercise of a right, rather than as the continuing
exercise of a claim. The usage is one of great convenience,
but it must not be misunderstood. To exercise a right means
to exercise a claim <em>as if it were a right</em>. There may be no
right in reality; and where there is a right, it may be vested
in some other person, and not in the possessor. If I possess a
way over another’s land, it may or may not be a <em>right</em> of way;
and even if it is a right of way, it may be owned by some one
else, though possessed by me. Similarly a trade-mark or a
patent which is possessed and exercised by me may or may
not be legally valid; it may exist <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> and not also <i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i>;
and even if legally valid, it may be legally vested not in me,
but in another.<a id='r249'></a><a href='#f249' class='c016'><sup>[249]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal possession
is clearly analogous to that between corporeal and incorporeal
ownership. Corporeal possession, like corporeal
ownership, is that of a thing; while incorporeal possession,
like incorporeal ownership, is that of a right. Now in the
case of ownership we have already seen that this distinction
between things and rights is merely the outcome of a figure
of speech, by which a certain kind of right is identified with
the material thing which is its object. A similar explanation
is applicable in the case of possession. The possession of a
piece of land means in truth the possession of the exclusive
use of it, just as the possession of a right of way over land
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>means the possession of a certain non-exclusive use of it.
By metonymy the exclusive use of the thing is identified
with the thing itself, though the non-exclusive use of it is
not. Thus we obtain a distinction between the possession
of things and the possession of rights, similar to that between
the ownership of things and the ownership of rights.<a id='r250'></a><a href='#f250' class='c016'><sup>[250]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In essence, therefore, the two forms of possession are
identical, just as the two forms of ownership are. Possession
in its full compass and generic application means <em>the continuing
exercise of any claim or right</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 106. <b>Relation between Possession and Ownership.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>“Possession,” says Ihering,<a id='r251'></a><a href='#f251' class='c016'><sup>[251]</sup></a> “is the objective realisation
of ownership.” It is in <em>fact</em> what ownership is in <em>right</em>.
Possession is the <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> exercise of a claim; ownership is the
<i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i> recognition of one. A thing is owned by me when my
claim to it is maintained by the will of the state as expressed
in the law; it is possessed by me, when my claim to it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>maintained by my own self-assertive will. Ownership is the
guarantee of the law; possession is the guarantee of the facts.
It is well to have both forms of security if possible; and
indeed they normally coexist. But where there is no law,
or where the law is against a man, he must content himself
with the precarious security of the facts. Even when the
law is in one’s favour, it is well to have the facts on one’s
side also. <i><span lang="la">Beati possidentes</span></i>. Possession, therefore, is the <i><span lang="la">de
facto</span></i> counterpart of ownership. It is the external form in
which rightful claims normally manifest themselves. The
separation of these two things is an exceptional incident, due
to accident, wrong, or the special nature of the claims in
question. Possession without ownership is the body of fact,
uninformed by the spirit of right which usually accompanies
it. Ownership without possession is right, unaccompanied
by that environment of fact in which it normally realises
itself. The two things tend mutually to coincide. Ownership
strives to realise itself in possession, and possession
endeavours to justify itself as ownership. The law of prescription
determines the process by which, through the influence
of time, possession without title ripens into ownership,
and ownership without possession withers away and
dies.<a id='r252'></a><a href='#f252' class='c016'><sup>[252]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Speaking generally, ownership and possession have the
same subject-matter. Whatever may be owned may be
possessed, and whatever may be possessed may be owned.
This statement, however, is subject to important qualifications.
There are claims which may be realised and exercised
in fact without receiving any recognition or protection from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>the law, there being no right vested either in the claimant or
in any one else. In such cases there is possession without
ownership. For example, men might possess copyrights,
trade-marks, and other forms of monopoly, even though the
law refused to defend those interests as legal rights. Claims
to them might be realised <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i>, and attain some measure of
security and value from the facts, without any possibility of
support from the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conversely there are many rights which can be owned,
but which are not capable of being possessed. They are
those which may be termed <em>transitory</em>. Rights which do not
admit of continuing exercise do not admit of possession either.
They cannot be exercised without being thereby wholly
fulfilled and destroyed; therefore they cannot be possessed.
A creditor, for example, does not possess the debt that is
due to him; for this is a transitory right which in its very
nature cannot survive its exercise. But a man may possess
an easement over land, because its exercise and its continued
existence are consistent with each other. It is for this reason
that obligations generally (that is to say, rights <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>
as opposed to <i><span lang="la">rights in rem</span></i>) do not admit of possession. It
is to be remembered, however, that <em>repeated</em> exercise is
equivalent in this respect to <em>continuing</em> exercise. I may
possess a right of way through repeated acts of use, just as
I may possess a right of light or support through continuous
enjoyment. Therefore even obligations admit of possession,
provided that they are of such a nature as to involve a series
of repeated acts of performance. We may say that a landlord
is in possession of his rents, an annuitant of his annuity,
a bondholder of his interest, or a master of the services of
his servant.<a id='r253'></a><a href='#f253' class='c016'><sup>[253]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>We may note finally that, although incorporeal possession
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>is possible in fact of all continuing rights, it by no means
follows that the recognition of such possession, or the attribution
of legal consequences to it, is necessary or profitable in
law. To what extent incorporeal possession exists in law,
and what consequences flow from it, are questions which are
not here relevant, but touch merely the details of the legal
system.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 107. <b>Possessory Remedies.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>In English law possession is a good title of right against
any one who cannot show a better. A wrongful possessor has
the rights of an owner with respect to all persons except
earlier possessors and except the true owner himself. Many
other legal systems,<a id='r254'></a><a href='#f254' class='c016'><sup>[254]</sup></a> however, go much further than this, and
treat possession as a provisional or temporary title even
against the true owner himself. Even a wrongdoer, who is
deprived of his possession, can recover it from any person
whatever, simply on the ground of his possession. Even
the true owner, who retakes his own, may be forced in this
way to restore it to the wrongdoer, and will not be permitted
to set up his own superior title to it. He must first give up
possession, and then proceed in due course of law for the
recovery of the thing on the ground of his ownership. The
intention of the law is that every possessor shall be entitled
to retain and recover his possession, until deprived of it by a
judgment according to law.</p>

<p class='c007'>Legal remedies thus appointed for the protection of possession
even against ownership are called <em>possessory</em>, while
those available for the protection of ownership itself may be
distinguished as <em>proprietary</em>. In the modern and medieval
civil law the distinction is expressed by the contrasted terms
<i><span lang="la">petitorium</span></i> (a proprietary suit) and <i><span lang="la">possessorium</span></i> (a possessory
suit).</p>

<p class='c007'>This duplication of remedies, with the resulting provisional
protection of possession, has its beginnings in Roman law. It
was taken up into the canon law, where it received considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>extensions, and through the canon law it became a
prominent feature of medieval jurisprudence. It is still
received in modern Continental systems; but although well
known to the earlier law of England, it has been long since
rejected by us as cumbrous and unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>There has been much discussion as to the reasons on which
this provisional protection of possession is based. It would
seem probable that the considerations of greatest weight are
the three following.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The evils of violent self-help are deemed so serious that
it must be discouraged by taking away all advantages which
any one derives from it. He who helps himself by force even
to that which is his own must restore it even to a thief. The
law gives him a remedy, and with it he must be content.
This reason, however, can be allowed as valid only in a condition
of society in which the evils and dangers of forcible
self-redress are much more formidable than they are at the
present day. It has been found abundantly sufficient to
punish violence in the ordinary way as a criminal offence,
without compelling a rightful owner to deliver up to a trespasser
property to which he has no manner of right, and
which can be forthwith recovered from him by due course of
law. In the case of chattels, indeed, our law has not found it
needful to protect possession even to this extent. It seems
that an owner who retakes a chattel by force acts within his
legal rights. Forcible entry upon land, however, is a
criminal offence.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. A second reason for the institution of possessory
remedies is to be found in the serious imperfections of the
early proprietary remedies. The procedure by which an
owner recovered his property was cumbrous, dilatory, and
inefficient. The path of the claimant was strewn with pitfalls,
and he was lucky if he reached his destination without
disaster. The part of plaintiff in such an action was one of
grave disadvantage, and possession was nine points of the
law. No man, therefore, could be suffered to procure for himself
by violence the advantageous position of defendant, and
to force his adversary by such means to assume the dangerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>and difficult post of plaintiff. The original position of affairs
must first be restored; possession must first be given to him
who had it first; then, and not till then, would the law consent
to discuss the titles of the disputants to the property in
question. Yet however cogent such considerations may
have been in earlier law, they are now of little weight. With
a rational system of procedure the task of the plaintiff is as
easy as that of the defendant. The law shows no favour to
one rather than to the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. A third reason for possessory remedies, closely connected
with the second, is the difficulty of the proof of ownership.
It is easy to prove that one has been in possession of a
thing, but difficult (in the absence of any system of registration
of title) to prove that one is the owner of it. Therefore
it was considered unjust that a man should be allowed by
violence to transfer the heavy burden of proof from his own
shoulders to those of his opponent. Every man should bear
his own burden. He who takes a thing by force must
restore it to him from whom he has taken it; let him then
prove, if he can, that he is the owner of it; and the law will
then give to him what it will not suffer him to take for
himself. But English law has long since discovered that it
is possible to attain this end in a much more satisfactory
and reasonable way. It adjusts the burden of proof of
ownership with perfect equity, without recourse to any such
anomaly as the protection of the possessor against the owner.
This it does by the operation of the three following rules:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Prior possession is <i><span lang="la">prima facie</span></i> proof of title. Even in
the ordinary proprietary action a claimant need do nothing
more than prove that he had an older possession than that
of the defendant; for the law will presume from this prior
possession a better title. <i><span lang="la">Qui prior est tempore potior est jure.</span></i></p>

<p class='c007'>2. A defendant is always at liberty to rebut this presumption
by proving that the better title is in himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. A defendant is not allowed to set up the defence of <i><span lang="la">jus
tertii</span></i>, as it is called; that is to say, he will not be heard to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>allege, as against the plaintiff’s claim, that neither the
plaintiff nor he himself, but some third person, is the true
owner. Let every man come and defend his own title. As
between A. and B. the right of C. is irrelevant.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the joint operation of these three rules the same purpose
is effected as was sought in more cumbrous fashion by
the early duplication of proprietary and possessory remedies.<a id='r255'></a><a href='#f255' class='c016'><sup>[255]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV.<br> <span class='c013'>PERSONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 108. <b>The Nature of Personality.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The purpose of this chapter is to investigate the legal
conception of personality. It is not permissible to adopt
the simple device of saying that a person means a human
being, for even in the popular or non-legal use of the term
there are persons who are not men. Personality is a wider
and vaguer term than humanity. Gods, angels, and the
spirits of the dead are persons, no less than men are. And
in the law this want of coincidence between the class of
persons and that of human beings is still more marked. In
the law there may be men who are not persons; slaves, for
example, are destitute of legal personality in any system
which regards them as incapable of either rights or liabilities.
Like cattle, they are things and the objects of rights; not
persons and the subjects of them. Conversely there are, in
the law, persons who are not men. A joint-stock company
or a municipal corporation is a person in legal contemplation.
It is true that it is only a fictitious, not a real person; but it
is not a fictitious <em>man</em>. It is personality, not human nature,
that is fictitiously attributed by the law to bodies corporate.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far as legal theory is concerned, a person is any being
whom the law regards as capable of rights or duties. Any
being that is so capable is a person, whether a human being
or not, and no being that is not so capable is a person, even
though he be a man. Persons are the substances of which
rights and duties are the attributes. It is only in this
respect that persons possess juridical significance, and this is
the exclusive point of view from which personality receives
legal recognition.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>But we may go one step further than this in the analysis.
No being is capable of rights, unless also capable of interests
which may be affected by the acts of others. For every right
involves an underlying interest of this nature. Similarly no
being is capable of duties, unless also capable of acts by which
the interests of others may be affected. To attribute rights
and duties, therefore, is to attribute interests and acts as
their necessary bases. A person, then, may be defined, for
the purposes of the law, as any being to whom the law
attributes a capability of interests and therefore of rights, of
acts and therefore of duties.</p>

<p class='c007'>Persons as so defined are of two kinds, distinguishable as
natural and legal. A natural person is a being to whom the
law attributes personality in accordance with reality and
truth. Legal persons are beings, real or imaginary, to whom
the law attributes personality by way of fiction, when there
is none in fact. Natural persons are persons in fact as well
as in law; legal persons are persons in law but not in fact.<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c016'><sup>[256]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 109. <b>The Legal Status of the Lower Animals.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The only natural persons are human beings. Beasts are
not persons. They are merely things—often the objects of
legal rights and duties, but never the subjects of them.
Beasts, like men, are capable of acts and possess interests.
Yet their acts are neither lawful nor unlawful; they are not
recognised by the law as the appropriate subject-matter
either of permission or of prohibition. Archaic codes did
not scruple, it is true, to punish with death in due course of
law the beast that was guilty of homicide. “If an ox gore
a man or a woman that they die: then the ox shall be
surely stoned and his flesh shall not be eaten.”<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c016'><sup>[257]</sup></a> A conception
such as this pertains to a stage that is long since past;
but modern law shows us a relic of it in the rule that the
owner of a beast is liable for its trespasses, just as a master
must answer for his servant, or a slave-owner for his slave.<a id='r258'></a><a href='#f258' class='c016'><sup>[258]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>This vicarious liability, however, does not involve any legal
recognition of the personality of the animal whose misdeeds
are thus imputed to its owner.</p>

<p class='c007'>A beast is as incapable of legal rights as of legal duties,
for its interests receive no recognition from the law. <i><span lang="la">Hominum
causa omne jus constitutum.</span></i><a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c016'><sup>[259]</sup></a> The law is made for men,
and allows no fellowship or bonds of obligation between them
and the lower animals. If these last possess moral rights—as
utilitarian ethics at least need not scruple to admit—those
rights are not recognised by any legal system. That which
is done to the hurt of a beast may be a wrong to its owner
or to the society of mankind, but it is no wrong to the beast.
No animal can be the owner of any property, even through
the medium of a human trustee. If a testator vests property
in trustees for the maintenance of his favourite horses or dogs,
he will thereby create no valid trust enforceable in any way
by or on behalf of these non-human beneficiaries. The only
effect of such provisions is to authorise the trustees, if they
think fit, to expend the property or any part of it in the way
so indicated; and whatever part of it is not so spent will go
to the testator’s representatives as undisposed of.<a id='r260'></a><a href='#f260' class='c016'><sup>[260]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There are, however, two cases in which beasts may be
thought to possess legal rights. In the first place, cruelty to
animals is a criminal offence, and in the second place, a trust
for the benefit of particular classes of animals, as opposed to
one for individual animals, is valid and enforceable as a
public and charitable trust; for example, a provision for the
establishment and maintenance of a home for stray dogs or
broken-down horses.<a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c016'><sup>[261]</sup></a> Are we driven by the existence of
these cases to recognise the legal rights and therefore the
legal personality of beasts? There is no occasion for any
such conflict with accustomed modes of thought and speech.
These duties towards animals are conceived by the law as
duties towards society itself. They correspond not to private
rights vested in the immediate beneficiaries, but to public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>rights vested in the community at large—for the community
has a rightful interest, legally recognised to this extent, in the
well-being even of the dumb animals which belong to it.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 110. <b>The Legal Status of Dead Men.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Dead men are no longer persons in the eye of the law.
They have laid down their legal personality with their lives,
and are now as destitute of rights as of liabilities. They have
no rights because they have no interests. There is nothing
that concerns them any longer, “neither have they any more
a portion for ever in anything that is done under the sun.”
They do not even remain the owners of their property until
their successors enter upon their inheritance. We have
already seen how, in the interval between death and the
entering of the heir, Roman law preferred to personify the
inheritance itself, rather than attribute any continued legal
personality or ownership to the dead man.<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c016'><sup>[262]</sup></a> So in English
law the goods of an intestate, before the grant of letters of
administration, have been vested in the bishop of the diocese
or in the judge of the Court of Probate, rather than left to
the dead until they are in truth acquired by the living.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet although all a man’s rights and interests perish with
him, he does when alive concern himself much with that
which shall become of him and his after he is dead. And
the law, without conferring rights upon the dead, does in some
degree recognise and take account after a man’s death of his
desires and interests when alive. There are three things,
more especially, in respect of which the anxieties of living
men extend beyond the period of their deaths, in such sort
that the law will take notice of them. These are a man’s
body, his reputation, and his estate. By a natural illusion a
living man deems himself interested in the treatment to be
awarded to his own dead body. To what extent does the
law secure his desires in this matter? A corpse is the property
of no one. It cannot be disposed of by will or any other
instrument,<a id='r263'></a><a href='#f263' class='c016'><sup>[263]</sup></a> and no wrongful dealing with it can amount to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>theft.<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c016'><sup>[264]</sup></a> The criminal law, however, secures decent burial for
all dead men, and the violation of a grave is a criminal offence.<a id='r265'></a><a href='#f265' class='c016'><sup>[265]</sup></a>
“Every person dying in this country,” it has been judicially
declared,<a id='r266'></a><a href='#f266' class='c016'><sup>[266]</sup></a> “has a right to Christian burial.” On the other
hand the testamentary directions of a man as to the disposal
of his body are without any binding force,<a id='r267'></a><a href='#f267' class='c016'><sup>[267]</sup></a> save that by
statute he is given the power of protecting it from the indignity
of anatomical uses.<a id='r268'></a><a href='#f268' class='c016'><sup>[268]</sup></a> Similarly a permanent trust
for the maintenance of his tomb is illegal and void, this being
a purpose to which no property can be permanently devoted.<a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c016'><sup>[269]</sup></a>
Even a temporary trust for this purpose (not offending
against the rule against perpetuities) has no other effect than
that already noticed by us as attributed to trusts for animals,
its fulfilment being lawful but not obligatory.<a id='r270'></a><a href='#f270' class='c016'><sup>[270]</sup></a> Property is
for the uses of the living, not of the dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reputation of the dead receives some degree of protection
from the criminal law. A libel upon a dead man
will be punished as a misdemeanour—but only when its
publication is in truth an attack upon the interests of living
persons. The right so attacked and so defended is in reality
not that of the dead, but that of his living descendants. To
this extent, and in this manner only, has the maxim <i><span lang="la">De mortuis
nil nisi bonum</span></i> obtained legal recognition and obligation.<a id='r271'></a><a href='#f271' class='c016'><sup>[271]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>By far the most important matter, however, in which the
desires of dead men are allowed by the law to regulate the
actions of the living is that of testamentary succession. For
many years after a man is dead, his hand may continue to
regulate and determine the disposition and enjoyment of the
property which he owned while living. This, however, is a
matter which will receive attention more fitly in another place.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ 111. <b>The Legal Status of Unborn Persons.</b></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Though the dead possess no legal personality, it is otherwise
with the unborn. There is nothing in law to prevent a
man from owning property before he is born. His ownership
is necessarily contingent, indeed, for he may never be born at
all; but it is none the less a real and present ownership. A
man may settle property upon his wife and the children to
be born of her. Or he may die intestate, and his unborn child
will inherit his estate. Yet the law is careful lest property
should be too long withdrawn in this way from the uses of
living men in favour of generations yet to come; and various
restrictive rules have been established to this end. No
testator could now direct his fortune to be accumulated for a
hundred years and then distributed among his descendants.</p>

<p class='c007'>A child in its mother’s womb is for many purposes regarded
by a legal fiction as already born, in accordance with the
maxim, <i><span lang="la">Nasciturus pro jam nato habetur</span></i>. In the words of
Coke: “The law in many cases hath consideration of him
in respect of the apparent expectation of his birth.”<a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c016'><sup>[272]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>To what extent an unborn person can possess personal as
well as proprietary rights is a somewhat unsettled question.
It has been held that a posthumous child is entitled to
compensation under Lord Campbell’s Act for the death of his
father.<a id='r273'></a><a href='#f273' class='c016'><sup>[273]</sup></a> Wilful or negligent injury inflicted on a child in the
womb, by reason of which it dies after having been born alive,
amounts to murder or manslaughter.<a id='r274'></a><a href='#f274' class='c016'><sup>[274]</sup></a> A pregnant woman
condemned to death is respited as of right, until she has been
delivered of her child. On the other hand, in a case in which
a claim was made by a female infant against a railway company
for injuries inflicted upon her while in her mother’s
womb through a collision due to the defendant’s negligence,
it was held by an Irish court that no cause of action was
disclosed.<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c016'><sup>[275]</sup></a> The decision of two of the four judges, however,
proceeded upon the ground that the company owed no duty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>of care towards a person whose existence was unknown to
them, and not upon the ground that an unborn child has in
no case any right of immunity from personal harm.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rights of an unborn person, whether proprietary or
personal, are all contingent on his birth as a living human
being. The legal personality attributed to him by way of
anticipation falls away <i><span lang="la">ab initio</span></i> if he never takes his place
among the living. Abortion is a crime; but it is not homicide,
unless the child is born alive before he dies. A posthumous
child may inherit; but if he dies in the womb, or is
stillborn, his inheritance fails to take effect, and no one can
claim through him, though it would be otherwise if he lived
for an hour after his birth.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 112. <b>Double Personality.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>It often happens that a single human being possesses a
double personality. He is one man, but two persons. <i><span lang="la">Unus
homo</span></i>, it is said, <i><span lang="la">plures personas sustinet</span></i>. In one capacity, or
in one right as English lawyers say, he may have legal relations
with himself in his other capacity or right. He may
contract with himself, or owe money to himself, or transfer
property to himself. Every contract, debt, obligation, or
assignment requires two persons; but those two persons may
be the same human being. This double personality exists
chiefly in the case of trusteeship. A trustee is, as we have
seen, a person in whom the property of another is nominally
vested, to the intent that he may represent that other in the
management and protection of it. A trustee, therefore, is for
many purposes two persons in the eye of the law. In right
of his beneficiary he is one person, and in his own right he is
another. In the one capacity he may owe money to himself
in the other. In the one capacity he may own an encumbrance
over property which belongs to himself in the other.
He may be his own creditor, or his own landlord; as where
a testator appoints one of his creditors as his executor, or
makes one of his tenants the trustee of his land.<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c016'><sup>[276]</sup></a> In all such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>cases, were it not for the recognition of double personality,
the obligation or encumbrance would be destroyed by
merger, or <i><span lang="la">confusio</span></i> as the Romans called it, for two persons at
least are requisite for the existence of a legal relation. No
man can in his own right be under any obligation to himself,
or own any encumbrance over his own property. <i><span lang="la">Nulli res
sua servit.</span></i><a id='r277'></a><a href='#f277' class='c016'><sup>[277]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 113. <b>Legal Persons.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>A legal person is any subject-matter to which the law
attributes a merely legal or fictitious personality. This extension,
for good and sufficient reasons, of the conception of
personality beyond the limits of fact—this recognition of
persons who are not men—is one of the most noteworthy
feats of the legal imagination, and the true nature and uses
of it will form the subject of our consideration during the
remainder of this chapter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The law, in creating legal persons, always does so by personifying
some real thing. Such a person has to this extent
a real existence, and it is his personality alone that is fictitious.
There is, indeed, no theoretical necessity for this, since the
law might, if it so pleased, attribute the quality of personality
to a purely imaginary being, and yet attain the ends for which
this fictitious extension of personality is devised. Personification,
however, conduces so greatly to simplicity of thought
and speech, that its aid is invariably accepted. The thing
personified may be termed the <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i> of the legal person so
created;<a id='r278'></a><a href='#f278' class='c016'><sup>[278]</sup></a> it is the body into which the law infuses the <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i>
of a fictitious personality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although all fictitious or legal personality involves personification,
the converse is not true. Personification in itself
is a mere metaphor, not a legal fiction. Legal personality
is a definite legal conception; personification, as such, is a
mere artifice of speech devised for compendious expression.
In popular language, and in legal language also, when strictness
of speech is not called for, the device of personification is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>extensively used. We speak of the estate of a deceased person
as if it were itself a person. We say that it owes debts, or
has debts owing to it, or is insolvent. The law, however,
recognises no legal personality in such a case. The rights and
liabilities of a dead man devolve upon his heirs, executors,
and administrators, not upon any fictitious person known as
his estate. Similarly we speak of a piece of land as entitled
to a servitude, such as a right of way over another piece. So,
also, in the case of common interests and actions, we personify
as a single person the group of individuals concerned, even
though the law recognises no body corporate. We speak of a
firm as a person distinct from the individual partners. We
speak of a jury, a bench of judges, a public meeting, the
community itself, as being itself a person instead of merely a
group or society of persons. But legal personality is not
reached until the law recognises, over and above the associated
individuals, a fictitious being which in a manner
represents them, but is not identical with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Legal persons, being the arbitrary creations of the law,
may be of as many kinds as the law pleases. Those which
are actually recognised by our own system, however, all fall
within a single class, namely corporations or bodies corporate.
A corporation is a group or series of persons which by a legal
fiction is regarded and treated as itself a person. If, however,
we take account of other systems than our own, we find
that the conception of legal personality is not so limited in its
application, and that there are at least three distinct
varieties. They are distinguished by reference to the different
kinds of things which the law selects for personification.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The first class of legal persons consists of corporations,
as already defined, namely those which are constituted by the
personification of groups or series of individuals. The individuals
who thus form the <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i> of the legal person are
termed its <em>members</em>. We shall consider this form of fictitious
personality more particularly in the sequel.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The second class is that in which the <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i>, or object
selected for personification, is not a group or series of persons,
but an institution. The law may, if it pleases, regard a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>church, or a hospital, or a university, or a library, as a person.
That is to say, it may attribute personality not to any group
of persons connected with the institution, but to the institution
itself. Our own law does not, indeed, so deal with the
matter. The person known to the law of England as the
University of London is not the institution that goes by that
name, but a personified and incorporated aggregate of human
beings, namely the chancellor, vice-chancellor, fellows, and
graduates. It is well to remember, however, that notwithstanding
this tradition and practice of English law, fictitious
personality is not limited by any logical necessity, or, indeed,
by any obvious requirement of expediency, to the incorporation
of bodies of individual persons.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The third kind of legal person is that in which the
<i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i> is some fund or estate devoted to special uses—a
charitable fund, for example, or a trust estate, or the property
of a dead man or of a bankrupt. Here, also, English law
prefers the process of incorporation. If it chooses to personify
at all, it personifies not the fund or the estate, but the
body of persons who administer it. Yet the other way is
equally possible, and may be equally expedient. The choice
of the <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i> into which the law shall breathe the breath of a
fictitious personality is a matter of form rather than of substance,
of lucid and compendious expression rather than of
legal principle.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 114. <b>Corporations.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We have now to consider more particularly the nature and
purposes of the legal conception of incorporation, inasmuch
as legal personality goes no further than this in English law.
Much of what is said in this special connection, however, will
be applicable <i><span lang="la">mutatis mutandis</span></i> to the other classes of legal
persons also.</p>

<p class='c007'>Corporations are of two kinds, distinguished in English law
as corporations aggregate and corporations sole. “Persons,”
says Coke,<a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c016'><sup>[279]</sup></a> “are of two sorts, persons natural created of God,&#160;... and persons incorporate or politique created by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>policy of man (and therefore they are called bodies politique);
and those be of two sorts, viz., either sole, or aggregate of
many.” A corporation aggregate is an incorporated <em>group</em> of
coexisting persons, and a corporation sole is an incorporated
<em>series</em> of successive persons. The former is that which has
several members at a time, while the latter is that which has
only one member at a time. Corporations aggregate are by
far the more numerous and important. Examples are a
registered company, consisting of all the shareholders, and a
municipal corporation, consisting of the inhabitants of the
borough. Corporations sole are found only when the successive
holders of some public office are incorporated so as to
constitute a single, permanent, and legal person. The
Sovereign, for example, is a corporation of this kind at common
law, while the Postmaster-General,<a id='r280'></a><a href='#f280' class='c016'><sup>[280]</sup></a> the Solicitor to the
Treasury,<a id='r281'></a><a href='#f281' class='c016'><sup>[281]</sup></a> and the Secretary of State for War<a id='r282'></a><a href='#f282' class='c016'><sup>[282]</sup></a> have been
endowed by statute with the same nature.<a id='r283'></a><a href='#f283' class='c016'><sup>[283]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is essential to recognise clearly the element of legal fiction
involved in both those forms of incorporation, for this
has been made by some writers a matter of dispute. A company
is in law something different from its shareholders or
members.<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c016'><sup>[284]</sup></a> The property of the company is not in law the
property of the shareholders. The debts and liabilities of the
company are not attributed in law to its members. The
company may become insolvent, while its members remain
rich. Contracts may be made between the company and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>shareholder, as if between two persons entirely distinct from
each other. The shareholders may become so reduced in
number that there is only one of them left; but he and the
company will be distinct persons for all that.<a id='r285'></a><a href='#f285' class='c016'><sup>[285]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>May we not go further still, and say that a company is capable of surviving
the last of its members? At common law indeed, a corporation is dissolved
by the death of all its members.<a id='r286'></a><a href='#f286' class='c016'><sup>[286]</sup></a> There is, however, no logical
necessity for any such rule, and it does not apply to corporations sole, for
beings of this sort lead a continuous life, notwithstanding the intervals
between the death or retirement of each occupant of the office and the
appointment of his successor. Nor is there any reason to suppose that
such a ground of dissolution is known to the trading corporations which are
incorporated under the Companies Acts. Being established by statute,
they can be dissolved only in manner provided by the statute to which they
owe their origin.<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c016'><sup>[287]</sup></a> The representatives of a deceased shareholder are not
themselves members of the company, unless they become registered as such
with their own consent. If, therefore, on the death of the last surviving
members of a private company, their executors refuse or neglect to be
registered in their stead, the company will no longer have any members.
Is it, for that reason, <i><span lang="la">ipso jure</span></i> dissolved? If not, it is clear that since a
company can survive its members and exist without them, it must be
something entirely distinct from them.<a id='r288'></a><a href='#f288' class='c016'><sup>[288]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In all those respects a corporation is essentially different
from an unincorporated partnership. A firm is not a person
in the eye of the law; it is nothing else than the sum of its
individual members. There is no fictitious being, standing
over against the partners, as a company stands over against
its shareholders. The property and debts of the firm are
nothing else than those of the partners. A change in the list
of partners is the substitution of a new firm for the old one,
and there is no permanent legal unity, as in the case of the
company. There can be no firm which consists of one partner
only, as a company may consist of one member. The incorporation
of a firm—that process by which an ordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>partnership is transmuted into a company—effects a fundamental
change in the legal relations of its members. It is
nothing less than the birth of a new being, to whom the whole
business and property of the partnership is transferred—a
being without soul or body, not visible save to the eye of the
law, but of a kind whose power and importance, wealth and
activity, are already great, and grow greater every day.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of corporations sole, the fictitious nature of
their personality is equally apparent. The chief difficulty
in apprehending the true nature of a corporation of this
description is that it bears the same name as the natural
person who is its sole member for the time being, and who
represents it and acts for it. Each of them is the Sovereign,
or the Solicitor to the Treasury, or the Secretary of State for
War. Nevertheless under each of these names two persons
live. One is a human being, administering for the time
being the duties and affairs of the office. He alone is visible
to the eyes of laymen. The other is a mythical being whom
only lawyers know of, and whom only the eye of the law can
perceive. He is the true occupant of the office; he never
dies or retires; the other, the person of flesh and blood, is
merely his agent and representative, through whom he performs
his functions. The living official comes and goes, but
this offspring of the law remains the same for ever.</p>

<p class='c019'>The doctrine that corporations are <i><span lang="la">personae fictae</span></i>, though generally
received, has not passed unchallenged. Attempts have been made in
recent years, especially by German jurists, to establish in place of it a new
theory which regards corporate personality as a reality, and not a fictitious
construction of the law. A corporation, it is said, is nothing more, in law
or in fact, than the aggregate of its members conceived as a unity, and
this unity, this organisation of human beings, is a real person and a living
organism, possessed of a real will of its own, and capable of actions and of
responsibility for them, just as a man is.</p>

<p class='c019'>With respect to this theory it is to be observed that, even if applicable
to corporations aggregate, it must leave corporations sole and the other
classes of legal persons to be explained in the older fashion. And even in
the case of corporations aggregate it seems impossible to admit that their
personality is anything more than the outcome of metaphor and fiction.
A society is not a person, but a number of persons. The so-called will of a
company is in reality nothing but the wills of a majority of its directors or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>shareholders. Ten men do not become in fact one person, because they
associate themselves together for one end, any more than two horses
become one animal when they draw the same cart. The apparent absurdity
of holding that a rich and powerful joint-stock company is a mere fiction
of the law, and possesses no real existence, proceeds not from the fiction-theory,
but from a misunderstanding of it. No one denies the reality of
the company (that is to say, the group of shareholders). What is in truth
denied is the reality of its personality. A group or society of men is a very
real <em>thing</em>, but it is only a fictitious <em>person</em>.<a id='r289'></a><a href='#f289' class='c016'><sup>[289]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 115. <b>The Agents, Beneficiaries, and Members of a Corporation.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Although corporations are fictitious persons, the acts and
interests, rights and liabilities, attributed to them by the law
are those of real or natural persons, for otherwise the law of
corporations would be destitute of any relation to actual fact
and of any serious purpose. Every corporation, therefore,
involves in the first place some real person or persons whose
interests are fictitiously attributed to it, and in the second
place some real person or persons whose acts are fictitiously
imputed to it. A corporation, having neither soul nor body,
cannot act save through the agency of some representative
in the world of real men. For the same reason it can have
no interests, and therefore no rights, save those which are
attributed to it as a trustee for or otherwise on behalf of
actual human beings.<a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c016'><sup>[290]</sup></a> Whatever a company is reputed to
do in law is done in fact by the directors or the shareholders
as its agents and representatives. Whatever interests, rights,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>or property it possesses in law are in fact those of its shareholders,
and are held by it for their benefit. Every legal
person, therefore, has corresponding to it in the world of
natural persons certain agents or representatives by whom it
acts, and certain beneficiaries on whose behalf it exists and
fulfils its functions. Its representatives may or may not be
different persons from its beneficiaries, for these two capacities
may or may not be united in the same individuals. The
shareholders of a company are not merely the persons for
whose benefit it exists; they are also those by whom it acts.
In the case of a corporation established for charitable purposes
it is otherwise, for the beneficiaries may have no share
whatever in the management of its affairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The representatives and beneficiaries of a corporation must
not be confounded with its members. These last are, as we
have seen, the individuals who form the group or series
personified by the law, and who so constitute the <i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i> or
body of the fictitious person thus created. Membership of
a corporation does not in itself affect in any way the rights
or liabilities of the members, for it is nothing more than a
matter of form. A man’s privileges and responsibilities in
respect of a corporation depend on whether he is one of its
representatives or beneficiaries, not on whether he is formally
accounted by the law as one of its members. Municipal
corporations are constituted by the incorporation of the
inhabitants of boroughs; but if by statute it were declared
that they should consist for the future of the mayor, aldermen,
and councillors, the change would not affect the rights,
powers, or liabilities of any human being.</p>

<p class='c007'>The extent to which the three classes of persons with
whom a corporation is concerned, namely its members, its
representatives, and its beneficiaries, are coincident and
comprise the same persons, is a matter to be determined as
the law thinks fit in the particular case. The members of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>a corporation may or may not be those by whom it acts, and
they may or may not be those on whose behalf it exists.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is worth notice that some or all of the members of a
corporation may be corporations themselves. There is
nothing to prevent the shares of a company from being held
by other companies. In this case the fiction of incorporation
is duplicated, and the law creates a fictitious person by the
personification of a group of persons who themselves possess
a merely legal and artificial personality.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 110 <b>The Acts and Liabilities of a Corporation.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>When a natural person acts by an agent, the authority of
the agent is conferred, and its limits are determined, by the
will and consent of the principal. In general only those
acts of the agent are imputed by the law to the principal,
which are within the limits of the agent’s authority as thus
created and circumscribed. But in the case of a corporation
it is necessarily otherwise. A legal person is as incapable
of conferring authority upon an agent to act on its behalf,
as of doing the act <i><span lang="la">in propria persona</span></i>. The authority of the
agents and representatives of a corporation is therefore conferred,
limited, and determined, not by the consent of the
principal, but by the law itself. It is the law that determines
who shall act for a corporation, and within what limits his
activity must be confined. Any act which lies beyond these
legally appointed limits will not be imputed to the corporation,
even though done in its name and on its behalf. It is
said to be <i><span lang="la">ultra vires</span></i> of the corporation, and as a corporate
act it is null and void.</p>

<p class='c007'>Speaking generally, we may say that a corporation can do
those things only which are incidental to the fulfilment of the
purposes for which the law created it. All its acts must be
directed to its legally appointed end. Thus the memorandum
of association of a company must set forth the purposes
for which it is established; and even the unanimous consent
of the whole body of shareholders cannot effectively enable
the company to act beyond the limits so marked out for its
activity.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>It is well settled in the law of England that a corporation
may be held liable for wrongful acts, and that this liability
extends even to those cases in which malice, fraud, or other
wrongful motive or intent is a necessary element. A company
may be sued for libel, malicious prosecution, or deceit.<a id='r291'></a><a href='#f291' class='c016'><sup>[291]</sup></a>
Nor is this responsibility civil only. Corporations, no less
than men, are within reach of the arm of the criminal law.
They may be indicted or otherwise prosecuted for a breach of
their statutory duties, and punished by way of fine and forfeiture.<a id='r292'></a><a href='#f292' class='c016'><sup>[292]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Although this is now established law, the theoretical basis
of the liability of corporations is a matter of some difficulty
and debate. For in the first place it may be made a question
whether such liability is consistent with natural justice. To
punish a body corporate, either criminally or by the enforcement
of penal redress, is in reality to punish the beneficiaries
on whose behalf its property is held, for the acts of the agents
by whom it fulfils its functions. So far, therefore, as the
beneficiaries and the agents are different persons, the liability
of bodies corporate is an instance of vicarious responsibility,
and it is to be justified on the same principles as are applicable
to the vicarious liability of a principal for the unauthorised
acts of his agent—principles which will be considered
by us at a later stage of our enquiry. For although
the representatives of a corporation are in form and legal
theory the agents of that fictitious person, yet in substance
and fact they are the agents of the beneficiaries. A company
is justly held liable for the acts of its directors, because in
truth the directors are the servants of the shareholders.</p>

<p class='c007'>A more serious difficulty in imposing liability upon bodies
corporate arises from the following consideration. The
wrongful acts so attributed by the law to fictitious persons
are in reality the acts of their agents. Now we have already
seen that the limits of the authority of those agents are
determined by the law itself, and that acts beyond those
limits will not be deemed in law to be the acts of the corporation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>How, then, can an illegal act be imputed to a
corporation? If illegal, it cannot be within the limits of
lawful authority; and if not within these limits, it cannot be
the act of the corporation. The solution of this difficulty is
twofold. In the first place, the argument does not extend to
wrongful acts of <em>omission</em>, for these are done by the body
politic in person, and not merely by its representatives. No
fictitious person can do in person what by law it ought not
to do, but it can in person fail to do what in law it ought.
And in the second place, the liability of a corporation for the
acts of its representatives is a perfectly logical application of
the law as to an employer’s liability for his servants. The
responsibility of a master does not depend on any authority
given to his servant to commit the wrongful act. It is the
outcome of an absolute rule of law that the employer is
himself answerable for all wrongs committed by his servant
in the course and process of doing that which he is employed
to do. I am liable for the negligence of my servant in
driving my carriage, not because I authorised him to be
negligent, but because I authorised him to drive the carriage.
So in the case of the agents of a corporation: the law imputes
to the corporation not only all acts which its agents are
lawfully authorised to do, but all unlawful acts which they
do in or about the business so authorised. The corporation
is responsible not only for what its agents do, being thereunto
lawfully authorised, but also for the manner in which
they do it. If its agents do negligently or fraudulently that
which they might have done lawfully and with authority,
the law will hold the corporation answerable.<a id='r293'></a><a href='#f293' class='c016'><sup>[293]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 117. <b>The Uses and Purposes of Incorporation.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>There is probably nothing which the law can do by the
aid of the conception of incorporation, which it could not do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>without it. But there are many things which it can by such
aid do better or more easily than would otherwise be possible.
Among the various reasons for admitting this fictitious
extension of personality, we may distinguish one as of
general and fundamental importance, namely, the difficulty
which the law finds in dealing with common interests vested
in large numbers of individuals and with common action in
the management and protection of such interests. The
normal state of things—that with which the law is familiar,
and to which its principles are conformed—is individual
ownership. With a single individual the law knows well
how to deal, but common ownership is a source of serious
and manifold difficulties. If two persons carry on a partnership,
or own and manage property in common, complications
arise, with which nevertheless the law can deal without
calling in the aid of fresh conceptions. But what if there
are fifty or a hundred joint owners? With such a state of
facts legal principles and conceptions based on the type of
individual ownership are scarcely competent to deal. How
shall this multitude manage its common interests and affairs?
How shall it dispose of property or enter into contracts?
What if some be infants, or insane, or absent? What shall
be the effect of the bankruptcy or death of an individual
member? How shall one of them sell or otherwise alienate
his share? How shall the joint and separate debts and
liabilities of the partners be satisfied out of their property?
How shall legal proceedings be taken by or against so great
a number? These questions and such as these are full of
difficulty even in the case of a private partnership, if the
members are sufficiently numerous. The difficulty is still
greater in the case of interests, rights, or property vested not
in individuals or in definite associations of individuals, but in
the public at large or in indeterminate classes of the public.</p>

<p class='c007'>In view of these difficulties the aim of the law has been to
reduce, so far as may be, the complex form of collective
ownership and action to the simple and typical form of
individual ownership and action. The law seeks some
instrument for the effective expression and recognition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>the elements of unity and permanence involved in the shifting
multitude with whose common interests and activities it has
to deal. There are two chief devices for this purpose,
namely trusteeship and incorporation. The objects of
trusteeship are various, and many of its applications have a
source and significance that are merely historical. In general,
however, it is used as a mode of overcoming the difficulties
created by the incapacity, uncertainty, or multiplicity of the
persons to whom property belongs. The property is deemed
by the law to be vested, not in its true owners, but in one or
more determinate individuals of full capacity, who hold it for
safe custody on behalf of those uncertain, incapable, or multitudinous
persons to whom it in truth belongs. In this manner
the law is enabled to assimilate collective ownership to
the simpler form of individual ownership. If the property
and rights of a charitable institution or an unincorporated
trading association of many members are held in trust by one
or two individuals, the difficulties of the problem are greatly
reduced.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is possible, however, for the law to take one step further
in the same direction. This step it has taken, and has so
attained to the conception of incorporation. This may be
regarded from one point of view as merely a development of
the conception of trusteeship. For it is plain that so long
as a trustee is not required to <em>act</em>, but has merely to serve
as a depositary of the rights of beneficiaries, there is no
necessity that he should be a real person at all. He may
be a mere fiction of the law. And as between the real and
the fictitious trustee there are, in large classes of cases, important
advantages on the side of the latter. He is <em>one</em>
person, and so renders possible a complete reduction of
common to individual ownership; whereas the objections to
a single trustee in the case of natural persons are serious and
obvious. The fictitious trustee, moreover, though not incapable
of dissolution, is yet exempt from the inevitable mortality
that afflicts mankind. He embodies and expresses,
therefore, to a degree impossible in the case of natural
trustees, the two elements of unity and of permanence which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>call for recognition in the case of collective interests. An
incorporated company is a permanent unity, standing over
against the multitudinous and variable body of shareholders
whose rights and property it holds in trust.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true, indeed, that a fictitious trustee is incapable of
acting in the matter of his trust in his proper person. This
difficulty, however, is easily avoided by means of agency, and
the agents may be several in number, so as to secure that
safety which lies in a multitude of counsellors, while the unity
of the trusteeship itself remains unaffected.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have considered the general use and purpose of incorporation.
Among its various special purposes there is one
which has assumed very great importance in modern times,
and which is not without theoretical interest. Incorporation
is used to enable traders to trade with limited liability. As
the law stands, he who ventures to trade <i><span lang="la">in propria persona</span></i>
must put his whole fortune into the business. He must
stake all that he has upon the success of his undertaking, and
must answer for all losses to the last farthing of his possessions.
The risk is a serious one even for him whose business is all his
own, but it is far more serious for those who enter into
partnership with others. In such a case a man may be called
upon to answer with his whole fortune for the acts or defaults
of those with whom he is disastrously associated.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not surprising, therefore, that modern commerce has
seized eagerly upon a plan for eliminating this risk of ruin.
Incorporation has proved admirably adapted to this end.
They who wish to trade with safety need no longer be so rash
as to act <i><span lang="la">in propria persona</span></i>, for they may act merely as the
irresponsible agents of a fictitious being, created by them for
this purpose with the aid and sanction of the Companies Act.
If the business is successful, the gains made by the company
will be held on behalf of the shareholders; if unsuccessful, the
losses must be borne by the company itself. For the debts of
a corporation are not the debts of its members. <i><span lang="la">Si quid universitati
debetur, singulis non debetur, nec quod debet universitas
singuli debent.</span></i><a id='r294'></a><a href='#f294' class='c016'><sup>[294]</sup></a> The only risk run by its members is that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>the loss of the capital with which they have supplied or undertaken
to supply the company for the purpose of enabling
it to carry on its business. To the capital so paid or
promised, the creditors of the insolvent corporation have
the first claim, but the liability of the shareholders extends
no further.</p>

<p class='c007'>The advantages which traders derive from such a scheme
of limited liability are obvious. Nor does it involve any
necessary injustice to creditors, for those who deal with companies
know, or have the means of knowing, the nature of
their security. The terms of the bargain are fully disclosed
and freely consented to. There is no reason in the nature
of things why a man should answer for his contracts with
all his estate, rather than with a definite portion of it
only, for this is wholly a matter of agreement between
the parties.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 118. <b>The Creation and Extinction of Corporations.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The birth and death of legal persons are determined not by
nature, but by the law. They come into existence at the will
of the law, and they endure during its good pleasure. Corporations
maybe established by royal charter, by statute, by
immemorial custom, and in recent years by agreement of
their members expressed in statutory forms and subject to
statutory provisions and limitations. They are in their own
nature capable of indefinite duration, this being indeed one of
their chief virtues as compared with humanity, but they are
not incapable of destruction. The extinction of a body corporate
is called its dissolution—the severing of that legal bond
by which its members are knit together into a fictitious unity.
We have already noticed that a legal person does not of necessity
lose its life with the destruction or disappearance of its
<i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i> or bodily substance. There is no reason why a corporation
should not continue to live, although the last of its
members is dead; and a corporation sole is merely dormant,
not extinct, during the interval between two successive occupants
of the office. The essence of a body corporate consists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>in the <i><span lang="la">animus</span></i> of fictitious and legal personality, not in the
<i><span lang="la">corpus</span></i> of its members.<a id='r295'></a><a href='#f295' class='c016'><sup>[295]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 119. <b>The State as a Corporation.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Of all forms of human society the greatest is the state. It
owns immense wealth and performs functions which in number
and importance are beyond those of all other associations.
Is it, then, recognised by the law as a person? Is the commonwealth
a body politic and corporate, endowed with legal
personality, and having as its members all those who owe
allegiance to it and are entitled to its protection? This is the
conclusion to which a developed system of law might be expected
to attain. But the law of England has chosen another
way. The community of the realm is an organised society,
but it is no person or body corporate. It owns no property,
is capable of no acts, and has no rights nor any liabilities imputed
to it by the law. Whatever is said to the contrary is
figure of speech, and not the literal language of our law.</p>

<p class='c007'>How, then, are we to account for this failure of the law to
make so obvious and useful an application of the conception
of incorporation and legal personality? Why has it failed to
recognise and express in this way the unity and permanence
of the state? The explanation is to be found in the existence
of monarchical government. The real personality of the
King, who is the head of the state, has rendered superfluous
any attribution of fictitious personality to the state itself.
Public property is in the eye of the law the property of the
King. Public liabilities are those of the King; it is he, and he
alone, who owes the principal and interest of the national
debt. Whatsoever is done by the state is in law done by the
King. The public justice administered in the law courts is
royal justice administered by the King through his servants
the judges. The laws are the King’s laws, which he enacts
with the advice and consent of his Parliament. The executive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>government of the state is the King’s government, which
he carries on by the hands of his ministers. The state has no
army save the King’s army, no navy save the King’s navy,
no revenues save the royal revenues, no territory save the
dominions of the King. Treason and other offences against
the state and the public interest are in law offences against
the King, and the public peace is the King’s peace. The
citizens of the state are not fellow-members of one body
politic and corporate, but fellow-subjects of one sovereign
lord.</p>

<p class='c007'>Insomuch, therefore, as everything which is <em>public</em> in fact is
conceived as <em>royal</em> by the law, there is no need or place for
any incorporate commonwealth, <i><span lang="la">respublica</span></i>, or <i><span lang="la">universitas
regni</span></i>. The King holds in his own hands all the rights, powers
and activities of the state. By his agency the state acts,
and through his trusteeship it possesses property and exercises
rights. For the legal personality of the state itself there
is no call or occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The King himself, however, is in law no mere mortal man.
He has a double capacity, being not only a natural person,
but a body politic, that is to say, a corporation sole. The
visible wearer of the crown is merely the living representative
and agent for the time being of this invisible and undying
<i><span lang="la">persona ficta</span></i>, in whom by our law the powers and prerogatives
of the government of this realm are vested. When the King
in his natural person dies, the property real and personal
which he owns in right of his crown and as trustee for the
state, and the debts and liabilities which in such right and
capacity have been incurred by him, pass to his successors in
office, and not to his heirs, executors, or administrators. For
those rights and liabilities pertain to the King who is a corporation
sole, and not to the King who is a mortal man.<a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c016'><sup>[296]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>In modern times it has become usual to speak of the Crown
rather than of the King, when we refer to the King in his
public capacity as a body politic. We speak of the property
of the Crown, when we mean the property which the King
holds in right of his crown. So we speak of the debts due by
the Crown, of legal proceedings by and against the Crown, and
so on. The usage is one of great convenience, because it
avoids a difficulty which is inherent in all speech and thought
concerning corporations sole, the difficulty, namely, of distinguishing
adequately between the body politic and the
human being by whom it is represented and whose name it
bears. Nevertheless we must bear in mind that this reference
to the Crown is a mere figure of speech, and not the recognition
by the law of any new kind of legal or fictitious person.
The Crown is not itself a person in the law. The only legal
person is the body corporate constituted by the series of
persons by whom the crown is worn. There is no reason of
necessity or even of convenience, indeed, why this should be
so. It is simply the outcome of the resolute refusal of English
law to recognise any legal persons other than corporations
aggregate and sole. Roman law, it would seem, found no difficulty
in treating the treasure-chest of the Emperor (<em>fiscus</em>) as
<i><span lang="la">persona ficta</span></i>, and a similar exercise of the legal imagination
would not seem difficult in respect of the Crown of England.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as our law refuses to personify and incorporate the
empire as a whole, so it refuses to personify and incorporate
the various constituent self-governing states of which the
empire is made up. There is no such person known to the
law of England as the state or government of India or of Cape
Colony.<a id='r297'></a><a href='#f297' class='c016'><sup>[297]</sup></a> The King or the Crown represents not merely the
empire as a whole, but each of its parts; and the result is a
failure of the law to give adequate recognition and expression
to the distinct existence of these parts.<a id='r298'></a><a href='#f298' class='c016'><sup>[298]</sup></a> The property and
liabilities of the government of India are in law those of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>British Crown. The national debts of the colonies are
owing by no person known to the law save the King of
England. A contract between the governments of two
colonies is in law a nullity, unless the King can make
contracts with himself. All this would be otherwise, did
the law recognise that the dependencies of the British
Empire were bodies politic and corporate, each possessing
a distinct personality of its own, and capable in its own
name and person of rights, liabilities, and activities.
Some of the older colonies were actually in this position,
being created corporations aggregate by the royal charters
to which they owed their origin: for example, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, and Connecticut. A similar corporate
character pertains to modern dependencies such as
the Chartered Company of South Africa. Even an unincorporated
colony of the ordinary type may become incorporate,
and so possessed of separate personality, by virtue of its own
legislation.<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c016'><sup>[299]</sup></a> In the absence of any such separate incorporation
of the different portions of the empire, their separate
existence can be recognised in law only by way of that doctrine
of plural personality which we have already considered
in another connection.<a id='r300'></a><a href='#f300' class='c016'><sup>[300]</sup></a> Although the King represents the
whole empire, it is possible for the law to recognise a different
personality in him in respect of each of its component parts.
The King who owns the public lands in Cape Colony is not
necessarily in the eye of the law the same person who owns
the public lands in England. The King, when he borrows
money in his capacity as the executive government of
Australia, may be deemed in law a different person from the
King who owes the English national debt. How far this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>plural personality of the Crown is actually recognised by the
common law of England is a difficult question which it is not
necessary for us here to answer.<a id='r301'></a><a href='#f301' class='c016'><sup>[301]</sup></a> It is sufficient to point out
that in the absence of any separate incorporation this is the
only effective way of recognising in law the separate rights,
liabilities, and activities of the different dependencies of the
Crown.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI.<br> <span class='c013'>TITLES.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 120. <b>Vestitive Facts.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We have seen in a former chapter that every right involves
a title or source from which it is derived. The title is the
<i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> antecedent, of which the right is the <i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i> consequent.
If the law confers a right upon one man which it does
not confer upon another, the reason is that certain facts are
true of him which are not true of the other, and these facts are
the title of the right. Whether a right is inborn or acquired,
a title is equally requisite. The title to a debt consists in a
contract, or a judgment, or other such transaction; but the
title to life, liberty, or reputation consists in nothing more
than in being born with the nature of a human being. Some
rights the law gives to a man on his first appearance in the
world; the others he must acquire for himself, for the most
part not without labour and difficulty. But neither in the one
case nor in the other can there be any right without a basis
of fact in which it has its root and from which it proceeds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Titles are of two kinds, being either <em>original</em> or <em>derivative</em>.
The former are those which create a right <i><span lang="la">de novo</span></i>; the latter
are those which transfer an already existing right to a new
owner. The catching of fish is an original title of the right of
ownership, whereas the purchase of them is a derivative title.
The right acquired by the fisherman is newly created; it did
not formerly exist in any one. But that which is acquired
by the purchaser is in legal theory identical with that which is
lost by the vendor. It is an old right transferred, not a new
one created. Yet in each case the fact which vests the
right is equally a title, in the sense already explained. For
the essence of a title is not that it determines the creation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>rights <i><span lang="la">de novo</span></i>, but that it determines the acquisition of rights
new or old.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the facts confer rights, so they take them away. All
rights are perishable and transient. Some are of feeble
vitality, and easily killed by any adverse influence, the bond
between them and their owners being fragile and easily
severed. Others are vigorous and hardy, capable of enduring
and surviving much. But there is not one of them that
is exempt from possible extinction and loss. The first and
greatest of all is that which a man has in his own life; yet
even this the law will deny to him who has himself denied it
to others.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts which thus cause the loss of rights may be called,
after Bentham, <em>divestitive facts</em>. This term, indeed, has never
been received into the accepted nomenclature of the law, but
there seems no better substitute available. The facts which
confer rights received from Bentham the corresponding name
of <em>investitive facts</em>. The term already used by us, namely title,
is commonly more convenient, however, and has the merit of
being well established in the law.<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c016'><sup>[302]</sup></a> As a generic term to include
both investitive and divestitive facts the expression
<em>vestitive fact</em> may be permissible.<a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c016'><sup>[303]</sup></a> Such a fact is one which
determines, positively or negatively, the <em>vesting</em> of a right in
its owner.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have seen that titles are of two kinds, being either
original or derivative. In like manner divestitive facts are
either <em>extinctive</em> or <em>alienative</em>. The former are those which
divest a right by destroying it. The latter divest a right by
transferring it to some other owner. The receipt of payment
is divestitive of the right of the creditor; so also is the
act of the creditor in selling the debt to a third person; but in
the former case the divestitive fact is extinctive, while in the
latter it is alienative.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is plain that derivative titles and alienative facts are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>two different classes of facts, but are merely the same facts
looked at from two different points of view.<a id='r304'></a><a href='#f304' class='c016'><sup>[304]</sup></a> The transfer of
a right is an event which has a double aspect. It is the acquisition
of a right by the transferee, and the loss of it by the
transferor. The vestitive fact, if considered with reference to
the transferee, is a derivative title, while from the point of
view of the transferor it is an alienative fact. Purchase is a
derivative title, but sale is an alienative fact; yet they are
merely two different sides of the same event.</p>

<p class='c007'>These distinctions and divisions are exhibited in the
following Table:</p>

<table class='table1'>
  <tr>
 <td class='brt c018' rowspan='4'>Vestitive Facts</td>

  <tr>
 
 
    <td class='c018'>Extinctive Facts.</td>
    <td class='c018'>Destruction of Rights.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c007'>These different classes of vestitive facts correspond to the
three chief events in the life history of a right, namely, its
creation, its extinction, and its transfer. By an original title
a right comes first into existence, being created <i><span lang="la">ex nihilo</span></i>; by
an extinctive fact it is wholly destroyed; by derivative titles
and alienative facts, on the other hand—these being, as we
have seen, the same facts viewed from different sides—the
existence of the right is in no way affected. The transfer of a
right does not in legal theory affect its personal identity; it is
the same right as before, though it has now a different owner.<a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c016'><sup>[305]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 121. <b>Acts in the Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Vestitive facts—whether they create, transfer, or extinguish
rights—are divisible into two fundamentally distinct
classes, according as they operate in pursuance of the will of
the persons concerned, or independently of it. That is to say,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>the creation, transfer, and extinction of rights are either
voluntary or involuntary. In innumerable cases the law
allows a man to acquire or lose his rights by a manifestation
or declaration of his will and intent directed to that end. In
other cases it confers rights upon him, or takes them away
without regard to any purpose or consent of his at all. If he
dies intestate, the law itself will dispose of his estate as it
thinks fit; but if he leaves a duly executed will in which he
expresses his desires in the matter, the law will act accordingly.
So if he sells his property, it passes from him in
accordance with his declared intent, which the law adopts as
its own; but if his goods are taken in execution by a creditor,
or vested in a trustee on his bankruptcy, the transfer is an
involuntary one, effected in pursuance of the law’s purposes,
and not of his at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distinction between these two classes of vestitive facts
may be variously expressed. We may make use, for example,
of the contrasted expressions <em>act of the party</em> and <em>act of the law</em>.
An act of the party is any expression of the will or intention of
the person concerned, directed to the creation, transfer, or extinction
of a right, and effective in law for that purpose; such
as a contract or a deed of conveyance. An act of the law, on
the other hand, is the creation, extinction, or transfer of a
right by the operation of the law itself, independent of
any consent thereto on the part of him concerned. The
expression act of the party is one of some awkwardness, however,
and it is more convenient in general to substitute for it
the technical term <em>act in the law</em>, as contrasted with those
acts <em>of</em> the law which we have already defined.<a id='r306'></a><a href='#f306' class='c016'><sup>[306]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Acts in the law are of two kinds, which may be distinguished
as <em>unilateral</em> and <em>bilateral</em>. A unilateral act is one in
which there is only one party whose will is operative; as in
the case of testamentary disposition, the exercise of a power
of appointment, the revocation of a settlement, the avoidance
of a voidable contract, or the forfeiture of a lease for breach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>of covenant. A bilateral act, on the other hand, is one
which involves the consenting wills of two or more distinct
parties; as, for example, a contract, a conveyance, a mortgage,
or a lease. Bilateral acts in the law are called <em>agreements</em>
in the wide and generic sense of that term. There is,
indeed, a narrow and specific use, in which agreement is
synonymous with <em>contract</em>, that is to say, the creation of rights
<i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i> by way of consent. The poverty of our legal
nomenclature is such, however, that we cannot afford thus
to use these two terms as synonymous. We shall therefore
habitually use agreement in the wide sense, to include all
bilateral acts in the law, whether they are directed to the
creation, or to the transfer, or to the extinction of rights. In
this sense conveyances, mortgages, leases, or releases are
agreements no less than contracts are.<a id='r307'></a><a href='#f307' class='c016'><sup>[307]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Unilateral acts in the law are divisible into two kinds in
respect of their relation to the other party concerned. For
in some instances they are adverse to him; that is to say,
they take effect not only without his <em>consent</em>, but notwithstanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>his <em>dissent</em>. His will is wholly inoperative and powerless
in the matter. This is so, for example, in the case of a re-entry
by a landlord upon a tenant for breach of covenant; or
the exercise of a power of appointment, as against the persons
entitled in default of appointment; or the avoidance of a
voidable contract; or the exercise by a mortgagee of his
power of sale. In other cases it is not so; the operation of
the unilateral act is subject to the dissent of the other party
affected by it, though it does not require his consent. In the
meantime, pending the expression of his will, the act has
merely a provisional and contingent operation. A will, for
example, involves nothing save the unilateral intent and
assent of the testator. The beneficiaries need know nothing
of it; they need not yet be in existence. But if they subsequently
dissent, and reject the rights so transferred to them,
the testament will fail of its effect. If, on the other hand,
they accept the provisions made on their behalf, the operation
of the will forthwith ceases to be provisional and becomes
absolute. Similarly a settlement of property upon trust need
not be known or consented to <i><span lang="la">ab initio</span></i> by the beneficiaries.
It may be a purely unilateral act, subject however to repudiation
and avoidance by the persons intended to be benefited
by it. So I may effectually grant a mortgage or other
security to a creditor who knows nothing of it.<a id='r308'></a><a href='#f308' class='c016'><sup>[308]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Where there are more than two parties concerned in any
act in the law, it may be bilateral in respect of some of them
and unilateral in respect of others. Thus a conveyance of
property by A. to B. in trust for C. may be bilateral as to A.
and B. <i><span lang="la">inter se</span></i>—operating by the mutual consent of these two—while
it may at the same time be unilateral as between A.
and B. on the one side and C. on the other—C. having no
knowledge of the transaction. So the exercise of a mortgagee’s
power of sale is bilateral as between mortgagee and
purchaser, but unilateral so far as regards the mortgagor.<a id='r309'></a><a href='#f309' class='c016'><sup>[309]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ 122. <b>Agreements.</b></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Of all vestitive facts, acts in the law are the most important;
and among acts in the law, agreements are entitled to
the chief place. Unilateral acts are comparatively infrequent
and unimportant. The residue of this chapter will therefore
be devoted to the consideration of the grounds, modes, and
conditions of the operation of agreement as an instrument of
the creation, transfer, and extinction of rights. A considerable
portion of what is to be said in this connection will,
however, be applicable <i><span lang="la">mutatis mutandis</span></i> to unilateral acts
also.</p>

<p class='c007'>The importance of agreement as a vestitive fact lies in the
universality of its operation. There are few rights which
cannot be acquired through the assent of the persons upon
whom the correlative duties are to be imposed. There are
few rights which cannot be transferred to another by the will
of him in whom they are presently vested. There are few
which are not extinguished when their owner no longer desires
to retain them. Of that great multitude of rights and duties
of which the adult member of a civilised community stands
possessed, the great majority have their origin in agreements
made by him with other men. By agreements of contrary
intent he may strip himself almost as destitute of rights and
duties, as when in the scantiest of juridical vesture he made
his first appearance before the law. <i><span lang="la">Invito beneficium non
datur</span></i>,<a id='r310'></a><a href='#f310' class='c016'><sup>[310]</sup></a> said the Romans.</p>

<p class='c007'>By what reasons, then, is the law induced to allow this far-reaching
operation to the fact of agreement? Why should
the mere consent of the parties be permitted in this manner
to stand for a title of right? Are not rights the subject-matter
of justice, and is justice a mere matter of convention
varying with the wills of men?</p>

<p class='c007'>The reasons are two in number. Agreement is in the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>place evidential of right, and in the second place constitutive
of it. There is in general no better evidence of the justice of
an arrangement than the fact that all persons whose interests
are affected by it have freely and with full knowledge consented
to it. Men are commonly good judges of their own
interests, and in the words of Hobbes “there is not ordinarily
a greater sign of the equal distribution of anything, than that
every man is contented with his share.” When, therefore,
all interests are satisfied, and every man is content, the law
may safely presume that justice has been done, and that
each has received his own. The determination of the law is
needed only in default of the agreement of the parties. Hence
it is, that he who agrees with another in any declaration of
their respective rights and duties will not be suffered to go
back from his word, and will not be heard to dispute the truth
of his declaration. The exceptions to this rule are themselves
defined by equally rigid rules; and he who would disclaim
a duty which he has thus imposed upon himself, or reclaim
a right which he has thus transferred or abandoned, must
bring himself within one of those predetermined exceptions.
Otherwise he will be held bound by his own words.</p>

<p class='c007'>This conclusive presumption of the truth of consensual
declarations of right is, however, only one of the foundations
of the law of agreement. Consent is in many cases truly
constitutive of right, instead of merely evidential of it. It is
one of the leading principles of justice to guarantee to men the
fulfilment of their reasonable expectations. In all matters
that are otherwise indifferent, expectation is of predominant
influence in the determination of the rule of right, and of all
the grounds of rational expectation there is none of such
general importance as mutual consent. “The human will,”
says Aquinas, “is able by way of consent to make a thing
just; provided that the thing is not in itself repugnant to
natural justice.”<a id='r311'></a><a href='#f311' class='c016'><sup>[311]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There is an obvious analogy between agreement and legislation—the
former being the private and the latter the public
declaration and establishment of rights and duties. By way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>of legislation the state does for its subjects that which in other
cases it allows them to do for themselves by way of agreement.
As to the respective spheres of these two operations,
the leading maxim is <i><span lang="la">Modus et conventio vincunt legem</span></i>. Save
when the interests of the public at large demand a different
rule, the autonomy of consenting parties prevails over the
legislative will of the state. So far as may be, the state leaves
the rule of right to be declared and constituted by the agreement
of those concerned with it. So far as possible, it contents
itself with executing the rules which its subjects have
made for themselves. And in so doing it acts wisely. For in
the first place, the administration of justice is enabled in this
manner to escape in a degree not otherwise attainable the
disadvantages inherent in the recognition of rigid principles
of law. Such principles we must have; but if they are established
<i><span lang="la">pro re nata</span></i> by the parties themselves, they will possess
a measure of adaptability to individual cases which is unattainable
by the more general legislation of the state itself.
Amid the infinite diversities and complexities of human
affairs the state wisely despairs of truly formulating the rules
of justice. So far as possible, it leaves the task to those who
by their nearness to the facts are better qualified for it. It
says to its subjects: Agree among yourselves as to what is
just in your individual concerns, and I shall enforce your
agreement as the rule of right.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the second place, men are commonly better content to
bear the burdens which they themselves have taken up, than
those placed upon them by the will of a superior. They
acquiesce easily in duties of their own imposition, and are
well pleased with rights of their own creation. The law or
the justice which best commends itself to them is that which
they themselves have made or declared. Wherefore, instead
of binding its subjects, the state does well in allowing them
to bind themselves.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 123. <b>The Classes of Agreements.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Agreements are divisible into three classes, for they either
create rights, or transfer them, or extinguish them. Those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>which create rights are themselves divisible into two subclasses,
distinguishable as <em>contracts</em> and <em>grants</em>. A contract is
an agreement which creates an obligation or right <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>
between the parties to it. A grant is an agreement which
creates a right of any other description; examples being
grants of leases, easements, charges, patents, franchises,
powers, licences, and so forth. An agreement which transfers
a right may be termed generically an <em>assignment</em>. One
which extinguishes a right is a <em>release</em>, <em>discharge</em>, or <em>surrender</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>As already indicated, a contract is an agreement intended
to create a right <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i> between the contracting parties.
No agreement is a contract unless its effect is to bind the
parties to each other by the <i><span lang="la">vinculum juris</span></i> of a newly created
personal right. It commonly takes the form of a promise or
set of promises. That is to say, a declaration of the consenting
wills of two persons that one of them shall henceforth be
under an obligation to the other naturally assumes the form
of an undertaking by the one with the other to fulfil the
obligation so created. Not every promise, however, amounts
to a contract. To constitute a contract there must be not
merely a promise to do a certain act, but a promise, express
or implied, to do this act as a legal duty. When I accept
an invitation to dine at another man’s house, I make him a
promise, but enter into no contract with him. The reason
is that our wills, though consenting, are not directed to the
creation of any legal right or to any alteration of our legal
relations towards each other. The essential form of a contract
is not: I promise this to you; but: I agree with you
that henceforth you shall have a legal right to demand and
receive this from me. Promises that are not reducible to this
from are not contracts. Therefore the consent that is
requisite for the creation of rights by way of contract is
essentially the same as that required for their transfer or extinction.
The essential element in each case is the express or
tacit reference to the legal relations of the consenting parties.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taking into account the two divisions of the consensual
creation of rights, there are, therefore, four distinct kinds of
agreements:—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>1. Contracts—creating rights <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Grants—creating rights of any other kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Assignments—transferring rights.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Releases—extinguishing rights.</p>

<p class='c019'>It often happens that an agreement is of a mixed nature, and so falls
within two or more of these classes at the same time. Thus the sale
of a specific chattel is both a contract and an assignment, for it transfers
the ownership of the chattel and at the same time creates an obligation
to pay the price. So a lease is both a grant and a contract, for it creates
real and personal rights at the same time. In all such cases the agreement
must be classed in accordance with its chief or essential operation, its
other effects being deemed subsidiary and incidental.</p>

<p class='c019'>A frequent result of the difference between law and equity, and between
legal and equitable rights and ownership, is that the same agreement has
one effect in law and another in equity. In law it may be a mere contract,
and in equity an assignment or a grant. Thus a written agreement for
the sale of land is in law nothing more than a contract, imposing upon the
seller a personal obligation to execute a conveyance under seal, but not in
itself amounting to a transfer of the ownership of the land. In equity, on
the other hand, such an agreement amounts to an assignment. The equitable
ownership of the land passes under it to the purchaser forthwith, and
the vendor holds the legal ownership in trust for him. Similarly a contract
to grant a <em>legal</em> lease or mortgage or servitude is itself the actual grant
of an <em>equitable</em> lease, mortgage, or servitude. For it is a maxim of Chancery
that equity regards that as already done which ought to be done.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 124. <b>Void and Voidable Agreements.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>In respect of their legal efficacy agreements are of three
kinds, being either <em>valid</em>, <em>void</em>, or <em>voidable</em>. A valid agreement
is one which is fully operative in accordance with the intent
of the parties. A void agreement is one which entirely fails
to receive legal recognition or sanction, the declared will of
the parties being wholly destitute of legal efficacy. A voidable
agreement stands midway between these two cases. It
is not a nullity, but its operation is conditional and not
absolute. By reason of some defect in its origin it is liable
to be destroyed or cancelled at the option of one of the parties
to it. On the exercise of this power the agreement not only
ceases to have any efficacy, but is deemed to have been void
<i><span lang="la">ab initio</span></i>. The avoidance of it relates back to the making of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>it. The hypothetical or contingent efficacy which has
hitherto been attributed to it wholly disappears, as if it had
never existed. In other words, a voidable agreement is one
which is void or valid at the election of one of the parties to it.
A lease determinable on notice or on re-entry for breach of
covenant is not for that reason voidable; because, when
determined, it is not destroyed <i><span lang="la">ab initio</span></i>, but merely from then
onwards.<a id='r312'></a><a href='#f312' class='c016'><sup>[312]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Void and voidable agreements may be classed together as
<em>invalid</em>. The most important causes of invalidity are six in
number, namely, (1) incapacity, (2) informality, (3) illegality,
(4) error, (5) coercion, and (C) want of consideration.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <em>Incapacity.</em> Certain classes of persons are wholly or
partially destitute of the power of determining their rights
and liabilities by way of consent. They cannot, at least to
the same extent as other persons, supersede or supplement the
common law by subjecting themselves to conventional law
of their own making. In the case of minors, lunatics, and
convicts, for example, the common law is peremptory, and
not to be derogated from or added to by their agreement. So
the agreements of an incorporated company may be invalid
because <i><span lang="la">ultra vires</span></i>, or beyond the capacity conferred upon it
by law.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. <em>Informality.</em> Agreements are of two kinds, which may
be distinguished as <em>simple</em> and <em>formal</em>. A simple agreement
is one in which nothing is required for its effective operation
beyond the manifestation, in whatever fashion, of the consenting
wills of the parties. A formal agreement, on the other
hand, is one in which the law requires not merely that consent
shall exist, but that it shall be manifested in some particular
form, in default of which it is held of no account.
Thus the intent of the parties may be held effective only if
expressed in writing signed by them, or in writing authenticated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>by the more solemn form of sealing; or it must be
embodied in some appointed form of words; or it must be
acknowledged in the presence of witnesses, or recorded by
some form of public registration; or it must be accompanied
by some formal act, such as the delivery of the subject-matter
of the agreement.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leading purpose of all such forms is twofold. They
are, in the first place, designed as pre-appointed evidence of
the fact of consent and of its terms, to the intent that this
method of determining rights and liabilities may be provided
with the safeguards of permanence, certainty, and publicity.
In the second place their purpose is that all agreements may
by their help be the outcome of adequate reflection. Any
necessary formality has the effect of drawing a sharp line
between the preliminary negotiations and the actual agreement,
and so prevents the parties from drifting by inadvertence
into unconsidered consent.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. <em>Illegality.</em> In the third place an agreement may be
invalid by reason of the purposes with which it is made.
To a very large extent men are free to agree together upon
any matter as they please; but this autonomous liberty is
not absolute. Limitations are imposed upon it, partly in the
interests of the parties themselves, and partly on behalf of
the public. There is much of the common law which will
not suffer itself to be derogated from by any private agreement;
and there are many rules which, though they in no
way infringe upon the common law, cannot be added to it as
supplementary. That is to say, there are many matters in
which the common law will admit of no abatement, and many
in which it will admit of no addition, by way of conventional
law. It is true in great part that <i><span lang="la">Modus et conventio vincunt
legem</span></i>; but over against this principle we must set the qualification,
<i><span lang="la">Privatorum conventio juri publico non derogat</span></i>. By <i><span lang="la">jus
publicum</span></i> is here meant that part of the law which concerns
the public interest, and which for this reason the agreements
of private persons cannot be allowed to infringe upon.<a id='r313'></a><a href='#f313' class='c016'><sup>[313]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>Agreements which in this way overpass the limits allowed
by the law are said in a wide sense to be illegal, or to be void
for illegality. They may or may not be illegal in a narrower
sense, as amounting in their making or in their performance
to a criminal or civil wrong.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. <em>Error or mistake.</em> Error or mistake, as a ground of
invalidity, is of two kinds, which are distinguishable as
<em>essential</em> and <em>unessential</em>. Essential error is that which is of
such a nature as to prevent the existence of any real consent
and therefore of any real agreement. The parties have not in
reality meant the <em>same</em> thing, and therefore have not in
reality agreed to <em>any</em> thing. Their agreement exists in
appearance only, and not in reality. This is the case if A.
makes an offer to B. which is accepted in mistake by C.; or
if A. agrees to sell land to B., but A. is thinking of one piece
of land, and B. is thinking of another. The effect of error of
this kind is to make the agreement wholly void, inasmuch as
there is in truth no agreement at all, but only the external
semblance and form of one.<a id='r314'></a><a href='#f314' class='c016'><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There is, however, an exception to this rule when the error
is due to the negligence of one of the parties and is unknown
to the other. For in such a case he who is in fault will be
estopped by his own carelessness from raising the defence of
essential error, and will be held bound by the agreement in
the sense in which the other party understood it.<a id='r315'></a><a href='#f315' class='c016'><sup>[315]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Unessential error, on the other hand, is that which does
not relate to the nature or contents of the agreement, but only
to some external circumstance, serving as one of the inducements
which led to the making of it; as when A. agrees to
buy B.’s horse because he believes it to be sound, whereas it
is in reality unsound. This is not essential error, for there
is a true <i><span lang="la">consensus ad idem</span></i>. The parties have agreed to the
same thing in the same sense, though one of them would not
have made the agreement had he not been under a mistake.
The general rule is that unessential error has no effect on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>the validity of an agreement. Neither party is in any way
concerned in law with the reasons which induced the other to
give his consent. That which men consent to they must abide
by, whether their reasons are good or had. And this is so
even though one party is well aware of the error of the other.<a id='r316'></a><a href='#f316' class='c016'><sup>[316]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This rule, however, is subject to an important exception,
for even unessential error will in general make an agreement
voidable at the option of the mistaken party, if it has been
caused by the misrepresentation of the other party. He who
is merely mistaken is none the less bound by his agreement;
but he who is misled has a right to rescind the agreement
so procured.<a id='r317'></a><a href='#f317' class='c016'><sup>[317]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>5. <em>Coercion.</em> In order that consent may be justly allowed
as a title of right, it must be free. It must not be the product
of any form of compulsion or undue influence; otherwise the
basis of its legal operation fails. Freedom, however, is a
matter of degree, and it is no easy task to define the boundary
line that must be recognised by a rational system of law. We
can only say generally, that there must be such liberty of
choice as to create a reasonable presumption that the party
exercising it has chosen that which he desires, and not
merely submitted to that which he cannot avoid. We cannot
usefully enter here into any examination of the actual results
that have been worked out in this matter by English law.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. <em>Want of consideration.</em> A further condition very commonly
required by English law for the existence of fully
efficacious consent is that which is known by the technical
name of <em>consideration</em>. This requirement is, however, almost
wholly confined to the law of contract, other forms of agreement
being generally exempt from it.</p>

<p class='c007'>A consideration in its widest sense is the reason, motive, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>inducement, by which a man is moved to bind himself by an
agreement. It is not for nothing that he consents to impose
an obligation upon himself, or to abandon or transfer a right.
It is in <em>consideration</em> of such and such a fact that he agrees to
bear new burdens or to forego the benefits which the law
already allows him. If he sells his house, the consideration of
his agreement is the receipt or promise of the purchase money.
If he makes a settlement upon his wife and children, it is in
consideration of the natural love and affection which he has
for them. If he promises to pay a debt incurred by him
before his bankruptcy, the consideration of his promise is the
moral obligation which survives his legal indebtedness to his
creditors. Using the term in this wide sense, it is plain that
no agreement made with knowledge and freedom by a
rational man can be destitute of some species of consideration.
All consent must proceed from some efficient cause. What,
then, is meant by saying that the law requires a consideration
as a condition of the validity of an agreement? The answer
is that the consideration required by the law is a consideration
of a kind which the law itself regards as sufficient. It is not
enough that it should be deemed sufficient by the parties, for
the law has itself authoritatively declared what facts amount
to a valid and sufficient consideration for consent, and what
facts do not. If men are moved to agreement by considerations
which the law refuses to recognise as good, so much the
worse for the agreement. <i><span lang="la">Ex nudo pacto non oritur actio.</span></i>
To bare consent, proceeding from no lawfully sanctioned
source, the law allows no operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>What considerations, then, does the law select and approve
as sufficient to support a contract? Speaking generally, we
may say that none are good for this purpose save those which
are <em>valuable</em>. By a valuable consideration is meant something
of value given by one party in exchange for the promise
of the other. By English law no promise (unless under seal
or of record) is binding unless the promisor receives a <i><span lang="la">quid
pro quo</span></i> from the promisee. Contracts which are purely unilateral,
all the obligation being on one side, and nothing
either given or promised on the other, are destitute of legal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>operation. Every valid contract<a id='r318'></a><a href='#f318' class='c016'><sup>[318]</sup></a> is reducible to the form of
a bargain that if I do something for you, you will do something
for me.</p>

<p class='c007'>The thing thus given by way of consideration must be of
some <em>value</em>. That is to say, it must be material to the
interests of one or other or both of the parties. It must
either involve some gain or benefit to the promisor by way of
recompense for the burden of his promise, or it must involve
some loss or disadvantage to the promisee for which the
benefit of the promise is a recompense. Commonly it
possesses both of these qualities at once, but either of them is
sufficient by itself. Thus if I promise gratuitously to take
care of property which the owner deposits with me, I am
bound by that promise, although I receive no benefit in
recompense for it, because there is a sufficient consideration
for it in the detriment incurred by the promisee in entrusting
his property to my guardianship. But if the thing given by
way of consideration is of no value at all, being completely
indifferent to both parties, it is insufficient, and the contract
is invalid; as, for example, the doing of something which
one is already bound to the other party to do, or the surrender
of a claim which is known to be unfounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>In certain exceptional cases, however, considerations which
are not valuable are nevertheless accepted as good and sufficient
by the law. Thus the existence of a legal obligation
may be a sufficient consideration for a promise to fulfil it; as
in the case of a promissory note or other negotiable instrument
given for the amount of an existing debt. At one time
it was supposed to be the law that a merely moral obligation
was in the same manner a sufficient basis for a promise of performance,
and though this is no longer true as a general proposition,
certain particular applications of the principle still
survive, while others have but recently been abolished by
statute. Thus a promise made by a discharged bankrupt to
pay a creditor in full was until recently a binding contract,
because made in consideration of the moral obligation which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>survives the legal indebtedness of an insolvent. For the
same reason, a promise made after majority to pay debts incurred
during infancy was binding, until the law was altered
in this respect by recent legislation. Similarly a promise to
pay a debt barred by prescription is legally valid even
yet, the consideration being the moral (and imperfect
legal) obligation which survives the period of prescription.</p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to the rational basis of this doctrine, it is to
be noticed that the requirement of consideration is not absolute,
but conditional on the absence of a certain formality,
namely that of a sealed writing. Form and consideration are
two alternative conditions of the validity of contracts and of
certain other kinds of agreements. It may be surmised,
therefore, that they are founded on the same reasons and
fulfil the same functions. They are intended as a precaution
against the risk of giving legal efficacy to unconsidered
promises and to the levities of speech. The law selects certain
reasons and inducements, which are normally sufficient for
reasoned and deliberate consent, and holds valid all agreements
made on these grounds, even though informal. In all
other cases it demands the guarantee of solemn form. There
can be little doubt, however, that our law has shown itself too
scrupulous in this matter; in other legal systems no such
precaution is known, and its absence seems to lead to no ill
results.</p>

<p class='c019'>Although the doctrine of consideration, in the form received by English
law, is unknown elsewhere, it is simply a modification of a doctrine known
to the civil law and to several modern systems, more especially to that of
France. Article 1131 of the French Civil Code provides that: “L’obligation
sans cause, ou sur une fausse cause, ou sur une cause illicite, ne peut
avoir aucun effet.”<a id='r319'></a><a href='#f319' class='c016'><sup>[319]</sup></a> This <em>cause</em> or <i><span lang="la">causa</span></i> is a synonym for consideration,
and we find the terms used interchangeably in the earlier English authorities.<a id='r320'></a><a href='#f320' class='c016'><sup>[320]</sup></a>
There is, however, an essential difference between the English and
the Continental principle. Unlike the former, the latter never rejects any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>cause or consideration as <em>insufficient</em>. Whatever motive or inducement is
enough to satisfy the contracting parties is enough to satisfy the law, even
though it is nothing more than the <i><span lang="la">causa liberalitatis</span></i> of a voluntary gift.
By an obligation <i><span lang="la">sans cause</span></i>, or contract without consideration, French
law does not mean a contract made without any motive or inducement
(for there are none such), nor a contract made from an inadequate motive
or inducement (for the law makes no such distinctions), but a contract made
for a consideration which has failed—<i><span lang="la">causa non secuta</span></i>, as the Romans called
it. The second ground of invalidity mentioned in the Article cited is the
<em>falsity</em> of the consideration (<i><span lang="la">falsa causa</span></i>). A consideration may be based
on a mistake, so that it is imaginary and not real; as when I agree to buy
a horse which, unknown to me, is already dead, or a ship which has been
already wrecked, or give a promissory note for a debt which is not truly
owing. Finally a <i><span lang="la">causa turpis</span></i>, or illegal consideration, is as fatal to a contract
in French and Roman law as in English.</p>

<p class='c019'>In English law the failure of consideration (<i><span lang="la">causa non secuta</span></i>) and its
unreality due to error (<i><span lang="la">causa falsa</span></i>) are grounds of invalidity, only when
the absence of such failure or error is expressly or impliedly made a condition
of the contract. In a contract for the sale of a chattel, for example,
the present existence of the chattel is an implied condition of the validity of
the sale.<a id='r321'></a><a href='#f321' class='c016'><sup>[321]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 125. <b>The Nature and Kinds of Liability.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>He who commits a wrong is said to be liable or responsible
for it. Liability or responsibility is the bond of necessity that
exists between the wrongdoer and the remedy of the wrong.
This <i><span lang="la">vinculum juris</span></i> is not one of mere duty or obligation; it
pertains not to the sphere of <em>ought</em> but to that of <em>must</em>. It
has its source in the supreme will of the state, vindicating its
supremacy by way of physical force in the last resort against
the unconforming will of the individual. A man’s liability
consists in those things which he <em>must</em> do or suffer, because
he has already failed in doing what he <em>ought</em>. It is the <em>ultimatum</em>
of the law.<a id='r322'></a><a href='#f322' class='c016'><sup>[322]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The purpose of this chapter and of the two which follow
it is to consider the general theory of liability. We shall
investigate the leading principles which determine the existence,
the incidence, and the measure of responsibility for
wrongdoing. The special rules which relate exclusively to
particular kinds of wrongs will be disregarded as irrelevant
to the purpose of our inquiry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Liability is in the first place either civil or criminal, and
in the second place either remedial or penal. The nature of
these distinctions has been already sufficiently considered in
a previous chapter on the Administration of Justice. We
there saw that civil liability is liability to civil proceedings,
and that a civil proceeding is one whose direct purpose is
the enforcement of a right vested in the plaintiff. Criminal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>liability, on the other hand, is liability to criminal proceedings,
and a proceeding of this nature is one whose direct purpose
is the punishment of a wrong committed by the defendant.<a id='r323'></a><a href='#f323' class='c016'><sup>[323]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>We also saw that the law often punishes a wrong by creating
and enforcing against the wrongdoer a new obligation; for
example, that of paying a pecuniary penalty or damages. In
such a case the direct purpose of the proceeding is the enforcement
of the sanctioning right thus created, though its
ulterior purpose is the punishment of the wrong in which this
right has its source. Hence the necessity of the further distinction
between penal and remedial liability. The former is
that in which the purpose of the law, direct or ulterior, is or
includes the punishment of a wrongdoer; the latter is that
in which the law has no such purpose at all, its sole intent
being the enforcement of the plaintiff’s right, and the idea of
punishment being wholly irrelevant. The liability of a
borrower to repay the money borrowed by him is remedial;
that of the publisher of a libel to be imprisoned, or to pay
damages to the person injured by him, is penal. All criminal
liability is penal; civil liability, on the other hand, is sometimes
penal and sometimes remedial.<a id='r324'></a><a href='#f324' class='c016'><sup>[324]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 126. <b>The Theory of Remedial Liability.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The theory of remedial liability presents little difficulty.
It may be laid down as a general principle, that, whenever
the law creates a duty, it should enforce the specific fulfilment
of it. The sole condition of the existence of remedial liability
is the existence of a legal duty binding upon the defendant
and unfulfilled by him. What a man ought to do by a rule
of law, he ought to be made to do by the force of law. In law
<em>ought</em> is normally equivalent to <em>must</em>, and obligation and
remedial liability are in general coexistent. To this general
principle, however, there are the following exceptions:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. In the first place, there are duties of imperfect obligation—duties
the breach of which gives no cause of action, and
creates no liability at all, either civil or criminal, penal or
remedial. A debt barred by the statute of limitations, or due
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>by the Crown, is a legal debt, but the payment of it cannot
be compelled by any legal proceedings.<a id='r325'></a><a href='#f325' class='c016'><sup>[325]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>2. Secondly, there are many duties which from their nature
cannot be specifically enforced after having once been broken.
When a libel has already been published, or an assault has
already been committed, it is too late to compel the wrongdoer
to perform his duty of refraining from such acts. Wrongs
of this description may be termed transitory; once committed,
they belong to the irrevocable past. Others, however,
are continuing; for example, the non-payment of a
debt, the commission of a nuisance, or the detention of
another’s property. In such cases the duty violated is in its
nature capable of specific enforcement, notwithstanding the
violation of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. In the third place, even when the specific enforcement
of a duty is possible, it may be, or be deemed to be, more
expedient to deal with it solely through the criminal law, or
through the creation and enforcement of a substituted sanctioning
duty of pecuniary compensation. It is only in special
cases, for example, that the law will compel the specific performance
of a contract, instead of the payment of damages
for the breach of it.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 127. <b>The Theory of Penal Liability.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We now proceed to the main subject of our inquiry,
namely, the general principles of penal liability. We have to
consider the legal theory of punishment, in its application
both to the criminal law and to those portions of the civil law
in which the idea of punishment is relevant and operative.
We have already, in a former chapter, dealt with the purposes
of punishment, and we there saw that its end is fourfold,
being deterrent, disabling, retributive, and reformative. The
first of these purposes, however, is primary and essential, the
others being merely secondary. In our present investigation,
therefore, we shall confine our attention to punishment as
deterrent. The inquiry will fall into three divisions, relating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>(1) to the conditions, (2) to the incidence, and (3) to the
measure of penal liability.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general conditions of penal liability are indicated with
sufficient accuracy in the legal maxim, <i><span lang="la">Actus non facit reum,
nisi mens sit rea</span></i>—The act alone does not amount to guilt; it
must be accompanied by a guilty mind. That is to say, there
are two conditions to be fulfilled before penal responsibility
can rightly be imposed, and we may conveniently distinguish
these as the <em>material</em> and the <em>formal</em> conditions of liability.
The material condition is the doing of some <em>act</em> by the person
to be held liable. A man is to be accounted responsible only
for what he himself does, not for what other persons do, or for
events independent of human activity altogether. The formal
condition, on the other hand, is the <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i> or guilty
mind with which the act is done. It is not enough that a man
has done some act which on account of its mischievous
results the law prohibits; before the law can justly punish
the act, an inquiry must be made into the mental attitude
of the doer. For although the act may have been materially
or objectively wrongful, the mind and will of the doer may
have been innocent.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall see later that the <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i> or guilty mind includes
two, and only two, distinct mental attitudes of the doer
towards the deed. These are intention and negligence.
Generally speaking, a man is penally responsible only for
those wrongful acts which he does either wilfully or negligently.
Then and only then is the <i><span lang="la">actus</span></i> accompanied by the
<i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i>. Then and then only do the two conditions of liability,
the material and the formal, coexist. In this case only
is punishment justifiable, for it is in this case alone that it
can be effective. Inevitable accident or mistake—the
absence both of wrongful intention and of culpable negligence—is
in general a sufficient ground of exemption from penal responsibility.
<i><span lang="la">Impunitus est</span></i>, said the Romans, <i><span lang="la">qui sine culpa
et dolo malo casu quodam damnum committit</span></i>.<a id='r326'></a><a href='#f326' class='c016'><sup>[326]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>We shall consider separately these two conditions of
liability, analysing first the conception of an act, and secondly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>that of <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i> in its two forms of intention and
negligence.<a id='r327'></a><a href='#f327' class='c016'><sup>[327]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 128. <b>Acts.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The term act is one of ambiguous import, being used in
various senses of different degrees of generality. When it is
said, however, that an act is one of the essential conditions of
liability, we use the term in the widest sense of which it is
capable. We mean by it any event which is subject to the
control of the human will. Such a definition is, indeed, not
ultimate, but it is sufficient for the purpose of the law. As to
the nature of the will and of the control exercised by it, it is
not for lawyers to dispute, this being a problem of psychology
or physiology, not of jurisprudence.</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) <em>Positive and Negative Acts.</em> Of acts as so defined there
are various species. In the first place, they are either positive
or negative, either acts of commission or acts of omission. A
wrongdoer either does that which he ought not to do, or leaves
undone that which he ought to do. The term act is often
used in a narrow sense to include merely positive acts, and
is then opposed to omissions or forbearances instead of including
them. This restriction, however, is inconvenient.
Adopting the generic sense, we can easily distinguish the two
species as positive and negative; but if we restrict the term
to acts of commission, we leave ourselves without a name for
the genus, and are compelled to resort to an enumeration of
the species.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) <em>Internal and external acts.</em> In the second place, acts
are either internal or external. The former are acts of the
mind, while the latter are acts of the body. In each case the
act may be either positive or negative, lying either in bodily
activity or passivity, or in mental activity or passivity. To
think is an internal act; to speak is an external act. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>work out an arithmetical problem in one’s head is an act of
the mind; to work it out on paper is an act of the body.
Every external act involves an internal act which is related
to it; but the converse is not true, for there are many acts of
the mind which never realise themselves in acts of the body.
The term act is very commonly restricted to external acts, but
this is inconvenient for the reason already given in respect of
the distinction between positive and negative acts.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) <em>Intentional and unintentional acts.</em> Acts are further
distinguishable as being either intentional or unintentional.
The nature of intention is a matter to which particular attention
will be devoted later, and it is sufficient to say here that
an act is intended or intentional when it is the outcome of a
determination of the actor’s will directed to that end. In
other words, it is intentional when it was foreseen and desired
by the doer, and this foresight and desire realised themselves
in the act through the operation of the will. It is unintentional,
on the other hand, when, and in so far as, it is not the
result of any determination of the will towards a desired issue.</p>

<p class='c007'>In both cases the act may be either internal or external,
positive or negative. The term omission, while often used in
a wide sense to include all negative acts, is also used in a
narrower signification to include merely unintentional negative
acts. It is then opposed to a forbearance, which is an
intentional negative act. If I fail to keep an appointment
through forgetfulness, my act is unintentional and negative;
that is to say, an omission. But if I remember the appointment,
and resolve not to keep it, my act is intentional and
negative; that is to say, a forbearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The term act is very commonly restricted to intentional
acts, but this restriction is inadmissible in law. Intention is
not a necessary condition of legal liability, and therefore cannot
be an essential element in those acts which produce such
liability. An act is an event subject to the control of the will;
but it is not essential that this control should be actually
exercised; there need be no actual determination of the will,
for it is enough that such control or determination is possible.
If the control of the will is actually exercised, the act
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>is intentional; if the will is dormant, the act is unintentional;
but in each case, by virtue of the existence of the power of
control, the event is equally an act. The movements of a
man’s limbs are acts; those of his heart are not. Not to
move his arms is an act; not to move his ears is not. To
meditate is an act; to dream is not. It is the power possessed
by me of determining the issue otherwise which makes any
event <em>my act</em>, and is the ground of my responsibility for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every act is made up of three distinct factors or constituent
parts. These are (1) its <em>origin</em> in some mental or bodily activity
or passivity of the doer, (2) its <em>circumstances</em>, and (3) its
<em>consequences</em>. Let us suppose that in practising with a rifle I
shoot some person by accident. The material elements of my
act are the following: its origin or primary stage, namely a
series of muscular contractions, by which the rifle is raised
and the trigger pulled; secondly, the circumstances, the
chief of which are the facts that the rifle is loaded and in
working order, and that the person killed is in the line of
fire; thirdly, the consequences, the chief of which are the
fall of the trigger, the explosion of the powder, the discharge
of the bullet, its passage through the body of the man killed,
and his death. A similar analysis will apply to all acts for
which a man is legally responsible. Whatever act the law
prohibits as being wrongful is so prohibited in respect of its
origin, its circumstances, and its consequences. For unless
it has its origin in some mental or physical activity or passivity
of the defendant, it is not his act at all; and apart
from its circumstances and results it cannot be wrongful.
All acts are, in respect of their origin, indifferent. No bodily
motion is in itself illegal. To crook one’s finger may be a
crime, if the finger is in contact with the trigger of a loaded
pistol; but in itself it is not a matter which the law is in
any way concerned to take notice of.</p>

<p class='c007'>Circumstances and consequences are of two kinds, according
as they are relevant or irrelevant to the question of
liability. Out of the infinite array of circumstances and the
endless chain of consequences the law selects some few as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>material. They and they alone are constituent parts of the
wrongful act. All the others are irrelevant and without legal
significance. They have no bearing or influence on the guilt
of the doer. It is for the law, at its own good pleasure, to
select and define the relevant and material facts in each particular
species of wrong. In theft the hour of the day is
irrelevant; in burglary it is material.</p>

<p class='c007'>An act has no <em>natural</em> boundaries, any more than an event
or a place has. Its limits must be artificially defined for the
purpose in hand for the time being. It is for the law to
determine, in each particular case, what circumstances and
what consequences shall be counted within the compass of
the act with which it is concerned. To ask what act a man
has done is like asking in what place he lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>By some writers the term act is limited to that part of the
act which we have distinguished as its origin. According
to this opinion the only acts, properly so called, are movements
of the body. “An act,” it has been said,<a id='r328'></a><a href='#f328' class='c016'><sup>[328]</sup></a> “is always
a voluntary muscular contraction and nothing else.” That
is to say, the circumstances and consequences of an act are
not part of it, but are wholly external to it. This limitation,
however, seems no less inadmissible in law than contrary to
the common usage of speech. We habitually and rightly include
all material and relevant circumstances and consequences
under the name of the act. The act of the murderer
is the shooting or poisoning of his victim, not merely the
muscular contractions by which this result is effected. To
trespass on another man’s land is a wrongful act; but the
act includes the circumstance that the land belongs to another
man, no less than the bodily movements by which the trespasser
enters upon it.<a id='r329'></a><a href='#f329' class='c016'><sup>[329]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It may be suggested that although an act must be taken to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>include some of its consequences, it does not include all of
them, but only those which are direct or immediate. Any
such distinction, however, between direct and indirect, proximate
and remote consequences, is nothing more than an
indeterminate difference of degree, and cannot be made the
basis of any logical definition. The distinction between an
act and its consequences, between doing a thing and causing
a thing, is a merely verbal one; it is a matter of convenience
of speech, and not the product of any scientific analysis of
the conceptions involved. There is no logical distinction
between the act of killing a man and the act of doing something
which results (however remotely) in his death.<a id='r330'></a><a href='#f330' class='c016'><sup>[330]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 129. <b>Two Classes of Wrongful Acts.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Every wrong is an act which is mischievous in the eye of
the law—an act to which the law attributes harmful consequences.
These consequences, however, are of two kinds,
being either actual or merely anticipated. In other words,
an act may be mischievous in two ways—either in its actual
results or in its tendencies. Hence it is, that legal wrongs are
of two kinds. The first consists of those in which the act is
wrongful only by reason of accomplished harm which in fact
ensues from it. The second consists of those in which the act
is wrongful by reason of its mischievous tendencies, as recognised
by the law, irrespective of the actual issue. In the first
case there is no wrong or cause of action without proof of
actual damage; in the second case it is sufficient to prove the
act itself, even though in the event no harm has followed it.</p>

<p class='c007'>For example, if A. breaks his contract with B, it is not
necessary for B. to prove that he was thereby disappointed in
his reasonable expectations, or otherwise suffered actual loss,
for the law takes notice of the fact that breach of contract is
an act of mischievous tendency, and therefore treats it as
wrongful irrespective of the actual issue. The loss, if any,
incurred by B. is relevant to the measure of damages, but
not to the existence of a cause of action. So if I walk
across another man’s field, or publish a libel upon him, I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>responsible for the act without any proof of actual harm resulting
from it. For trespass and libel belong to the class of acts
which are judged wrongful in respect of their tendencies, and
not merely in respect of their results. In other cases, on the
contrary, actual damage is essential to the cause of action.
Slander, for example, is in general not actionable without
proof of some loss sustained by the plaintiff, although libel
is actionable <i><span lang="la">per se</span></i>. So if by negligent driving I expose
others to the risk of being run over, I am not deemed guilty
of any wrong until an accident actually happens. The
dangerous tendency of the act is not in this case considered
a sufficient ground of liability.</p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to this distinction between wrongs which do
and those which do not, require proof of actual damage, it is
to be noticed that criminal wrongs commonly belong to the
latter class. Criminal liability is usually sufficiently established
by proof of some act which the law deems dangerous
in its tendencies, even though the issue is in fact harmless.
The formula of the criminal law is usually: “If you do this,
you will be held liable in all events,” and not: “If you do
this you will be held liable if any harm ensues.” An unsuccessful
attempt is a ground of criminal liability, no less
than a completed offence. This, however, is not invariably
so, for criminal responsibility, like civil, sometimes depends
on the accident of the event. If I am negligent in the use
of firearms, and kill some one in consequence, I am criminally
liable for manslaughter; but if by good luck my negligence
results in no accomplished mischief, I am free from all
responsibility.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to civil liability, no corresponding general principle
can be laid down. In some cases proof of actual damage is
required, while in other cases there is no such necessity; and
the matter pertains to the detailed exposition of the law,
rather than to legal theory. It is to be noted, however,
that whenever this requirement exists, it imports into the
administration of civil justice an element of capriciousness
from which the criminal law is commonly free. In point of
criminal responsibility men are judged by their acts and by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>the mischievous tendencies of them, but in point of civil
liability they are often judged by the actual event. If I
attempt to execute a wrongful purpose, I am criminally
responsible whether I succeed or not; but my civil liability
will often depend upon the accident of the result. Failure in
a guilty endeavour amounts to innocence. Instead of saying:
“Do this, and you will be held accountable for it,” the
civil law often says: “Do this if you wish, but remember
that you do it at your peril, and if evil consequences chance to
follow, you will be answerable for them.”</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 130. <b><span lang="la">Damnum sine Injuria.</span></b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Although all wrongs are, in fact or in legal theory, mischievous
acts, the converse is not true. All damage done is
not wrongful. There are cases in which the law will suffer
a man knowingly and wilfully to inflict harm upon another,
and will not hold him accountable for it. Harm of this
description—mischief that is not wrongful because it does
not fulfil even the material conditions of responsibility—is
called <i><span lang="la">damnum sine injuria</span></i>, the term <i><span lang="la">injuria</span></i> being here used
in its true sense of an act contrary to law (<i><span lang="la">in jus</span></i>), not in its
modern and corrupt sense of harm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cases of <i><span lang="la">damnum sine injuria</span></i> fall under two heads. There
are, in the first place, instances in which the harm done to
the individual is nevertheless a gain to society at large. The
wrongs of individuals are such only because, and only so far
as, they are at the same time the wrongs of the whole community;
and so far as this coincidence is imperfect, the
harm done to an individual is <i><span lang="la">damnum sine injuria</span></i>. The
special result of competition in trade may be ruin to many;
but the general result is, or is deemed to be, a gain to society
as a whole. Competitors, therefore, do each other harm but
not injury. So a landowner may do many things on his own
land, which are detrimental to the interests of adjoining
proprietors. He may so excavate his land as to withdraw
the support required by the buildings on the adjoining
property; he may prevent the access of light to the windows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>of those buildings; he may drain away the water which
supplies his neighbour’s well. These things are harmful to
individuals; but it is held to serve the public interest to allow
a man, within wide limits, to do as he pleases with his own.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second head of <i><span lang="la">damnum sine injuria</span></i> includes all those
cases in which, although real harm is done to the community,
yet owing to its triviality, or to the difficulty of proof, or to
any other reason, it is considered inexpedient to attempt its
prevention by the law. The mischief is of such a nature
that the legal remedy would be worse than the disease.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 131. <b>The Place and Time of an Act.</b></h3>

<p class='c021'>Chiefly, though not exclusively, in consequence of the territorial limits
of the jurisdiction of courts, it is often material to determine the place in
which an act is done. In general this inquiry presents no difficulty, but
there are two cases which require special consideration. The first is that in
which the act is done partly in one place and partly in another. If a man
standing on the English side of the Border fires at and kills a man on the
Scottish side, has he committed murder in England or in Scotland? If a
contract is made by correspondence between a merchant in London and
another in Paris, is the contract made in England or in France? If by
false representations made in Melbourne a man obtains goods in Sydney, is
the offence of obtaining goods by false pretences committed in Victoria or in
New South Wales? As a matter of fact and of strict logic the correct
answer in all these cases is that the act is not done either in the one place or
in the other. He who in England shoots a man in Scotland commits murder
in Great Britain, regarded as a unity, but not in either of its parts taken
in isolation. But no such answer is allowable in law; for, so long as distinct
territorial areas of jurisdiction are recognised, the law must assume
that it is possible to determine with respect to every act the particular area
within which it is committed.</p>

<p class='c019'>What locality, therefore, does the law attribute to acts which thus fall
partly within one territorial division and partly within another? There
are three possible answers. It may be said that the act is committed in both
places, or solely in that in which it has its commencement, or solely in that
in which it is completed. The law is free to choose such one of these three
alternatives as it thinks fit in the particular case. The last of them seems
to be that which is adopted for most purposes. It has been held that
murder is committed in the place in which the death occurs,<a id='r331'></a><a href='#f331' class='c016'><sup>[331]</sup></a> and not
also in the place in which the act causing the death is done,<a id='r332'></a><a href='#f332' class='c016'><sup>[332]</sup></a> but the law
on these points is not free from doubt.<a id='r333'></a><a href='#f333' class='c016'><sup>[333]</sup></a> A contract is made in the place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>where it is completed, that is to say, where the offer is accepted<a id='r334'></a><a href='#f334' class='c016'><sup>[334]</sup></a> or the
last necessary signature to the document is affixed.<a id='r335'></a><a href='#f335' class='c016'><sup>[335]</sup></a> The offence of obtaining
goods by false pretences is committed in the place in which the
goods are obtained<a id='r336'></a><a href='#f336' class='c016'><sup>[336]</sup></a> and not in the place where the false pretence is made.<a id='r337'></a><a href='#f337' class='c016'><sup>[337]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>A second case in which the determination of the locality of an act
gives rise to difficulty is that of negative acts. In what place does a man
omit to pay a debt or to perform a contract? The true answer is apparently
that a negative act takes place where the corresponding positive
act <em>ought</em> to have taken place. An omission to pay a debt occurs in the
place where the debt is payable.<a id='r338'></a><a href='#f338' class='c016'><sup>[338]</sup></a> If I make in England a contract to be
performed in France, my failure to perform it takes place in France and
not in England. The presence of a negative act is the absence of the
corresponding positive act, and the positive act is absent from the place in
which it ought to have been present.</p>

<p class='c019'><em>The time of an act.</em> The position of an act in time is determined by the
same considerations as its position in space. An act which begins to-day
and is completed to-morrow is in truth done neither to-day nor to-morrow,
but in that space of time which includes both. But if necessary the law
may date it from its commencement, or from its completion, or may regard
it as continuing through both periods. For most purposes the date of
an act is the date of its completion, just as its place is the place of its completion.<a id='r339'></a><a href='#f339' class='c016'><sup>[339]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>A negative act is done at the time at which the corresponding positive
act ought to have been done. The date of the non-payment of a debt

<h3 class='c017'>§ 132. <b>Mens Rea.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We have seen that the conditions of penal liability are
sufficiently indicated by the maxim, <i><span lang="la">Actus non facit reum, nisi
mens sit rea</span></i>. A man is responsible not for his acts in themselves,
but for his acts coupled with the <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i> or guilty
mind with which he does them. Before imposing punishment,
whether civilly or criminally, the law must be satisfied
of two things: first, that an act has been done which by
reason of its harmful tendencies or results is fit to be repressed
by way of penal discipline; and secondly, that the mental
attitude of the doer towards his deed was such as to render
punishment effective as a deterrent for the future, and therefore
just. The first is the material, the second is the formal
condition of liability. The <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i> may assume one or
other of two distinct forms, namely wrongful intention or
culpable negligence. The offender may either have done the
wrongful act on purpose, or he may have done it carelessly,
and in each case the mental attitude of the doer is such as to
make punishment effective. If he intentionally chose the
wrong, penal discipline will furnish him with a sufficient
motive to choose the right instead for the future. If, on the
other hand, he committed the forbidden act without wrongful
intent, but yet for want of sufficient care devoted to the
avoidance of it, punishment will be an effective inducement
to carefulness in the future. But if his act is neither intentional
nor negligent, if he not only did not intend it, but did
his best as a reasonable man to avoid it, there can be no good
purpose fulfilled in ordinary cases by holding him liable for it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet there are exceptional cases in which, for sufficient or
insufficient reasons, the law sees fit to break through the rule
as to <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i>. It disregards the formal condition of liability,
and is satisfied with the material condition alone. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>holds a man responsible for his acts, independently altogether
of any wrongful intention or culpable negligence. Wrongs
which are thus independent of <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i> may be distinguished
as wrongs of <em>absolute liability</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It follows that in respect of the requirement of <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i>
wrongs are of three kinds:</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) Intentional or Wilful Wrongs, in which the <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i>
amounts to intention, purpose, or design.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) Wrongs of Negligence, in which the <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i> assumes
the less serious form of mere carelessness, as opposed to
wrongful intent.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) Wrongs of Absolute Liability, in which the <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i> is
not required, neither wrongful intent not culpable negligence
being recognised as a necessary condition of responsibility.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall deal with these three classes of wrongs, and these
three forms of liability, in the order mentioned.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 133. <b>The Nature of Intention.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Intention is the purpose or design with which an act is done.
It is the foreknowledge of the act, coupled with the desire of
it, such foreknowledge and desire being the cause of the act,
inasmuch as they fulfil themselves through the operation of
the will. An act is intentional if, and in so far as, it exists in
idea before it exists in fact, the idea realising itself in the fact
because of the desire by which it is accompanied.<a id='r340'></a><a href='#f340' class='c016'><sup>[340]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>An act may be wholly unintentional, or wholly intentional,
or intentional in part only. It is wholly unintentional if no
part of it is the outcome of any conscious purpose or design,
no part of it having existed in idea before it became realised in
fact. I may omit to pay a debt, because I have completely
forgotten that it exists; or I may, through careless handling,
accidentally press the trigger of a pistol in my hand and so
wound a bystander. An act is wholly intentional, on the
other hand, when every part of it corresponds to the precedent
idea of it, which was present in the actor’s mind, and of
which it is the outcome and realisation. The issue falls completely
within the boundaries of the intent. Finally an act
may be in part intentional and in part unintentional. The
idea and the fact, the will and the deed, the design and the
issue, may be only partially coincident. If I throw stones,
I may intend to break a window but not to do personal harm
to any one; yet in the result I may do both of these things.</p>

<p class='c007'>An act, and therefore a wrong, which is intended only in
part, must be classed as unintended, just as a thing which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>completed only in part is incomplete. If any constituent
element or essential factor of the complete wrong falls outside
the limits of the doer’s intent he cannot be dealt with on the
footing of wilful wrongdoing. If liability in such a case exists
at all, it must be either absolute or based on negligence.<a id='r341'></a><a href='#f341' class='c016'><sup>[341]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A wrong is intentional, only when the intention extends to
all the elements of the wrong, and therefore to its circumstances
no less than to its origin and its consequences. We
cannot say, indeed, that the circumstances are intended or
intentional; but the act is intentional with respect to the
circumstances, inasmuch as they are included in that precedent
idea which constitutes the intention of the act. So
far, therefore, as the knowledge of the doer does not extend to
any material circumstance, the wrong is, as to that circumstance,
unintentional. To trespass on A.’s land believing it
to be one’s own is not a wilful wrong. The trespasser intended,
indeed, to enter upon the land, but he did not intend
to enter upon land belonging to A. His act was unintentional
as to the circumstance that the land belonged to A. So if
a woman marries again during the lifetime of her former
husband, but believing him to be dead, she does not wilfully
commit the crime of bigamy, for one of the material circumstances
lies outside her intention. With respect to that
circumstance the will and the deed are not coincident.</p>

<p class='c006'>Intention does not necessarily involve <em>expectation</em>. I may
intend a result which I well know to be extremely improbable.
So an act may be intentional with respect to a particular
circumstance, although the chance of the existence of
that circumstance is known to be exceedingly small. Intention
is the foresight of a desired issue, however improbable—not
the foresight of an undesired issue, however probable. If
I fire a rifle in the direction of a man half a mile away, I may
know perfectly well that the chance of hitting him is not one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>in a thousand; I may fully expect to miss him; nevertheless I
intend to hit him if I desire to do so. He who steals a letter
containing a cheque, intentionally steals the cheque also, if
he hopes that the letter may contain one, even though he
well knows that the odds against the existence of such a circumstance
are very great.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conversely, expectation does not in itself amount to intention.
An operating surgeon may know very well that
his patient will probably die of the operation; yet he does
not intend the fatal consequence which he expects. He intends
the recovery which he hopes for but does not expect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although nothing can be intended which is not desired, it
must be carefully noticed that a thing may be desired, and
therefore intended, not in itself or for its own sake, but for the
sake of something else with which it is necessarily connected.
If I desire and intend a certain end, I also desire and intend
the means by which this end is to be obtained, even though
in themselves those means may be indifferent, or even objects
of aversion. If I kill a man in order to rob him, I desire and
intend his death, even though I deeply regret, in his interests
or in my own, the necessity of it. In the same way, the desire
and intention of an end extend not merely to the means by
which it is obtained, but to all necessary concomitants without
which it cannot be obtained. If an anarchist, desiring to
kill the emperor, throws a bomb into his carriage, knowing
that if it explodes and kills him it will also kill others who are
riding with him, the assassin both desires and intends to kill
those others. This additional slaughter may <em>in itself</em> be in no
way desired by him; he may be genuinely sorry for it; yet
it falls within the boundaries of his desire and of his intent,
since it is believed by him to be a necessary concomitant of
the end which he primarily seeks. The deaths of the
emperor and of the members of his suite are inseparably connected,
and they constitute, therefore, a single issue which
must be desired and intended as a unity or not at all. When
I know or believe that A. cannot be had without B., I cannot
say that I intend A. but not B. If I desire A. sufficiently to
overcome my aversion to B., then I desire the total issue of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>which A. and B. are the two inseparable factors. With
respect to all circumstances which I know or believe to exist,
and with respect to all consequences which I know or believe
to be inevitable, my act is intentional, however undesirable
those circumstances or consequences may be in themselves.
I choose them deliberately and consciously as necessary
incidents of that which I desire and intend for its own sake.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any genuine belief, however, that an event may not happen,
coupled with a genuine desire that it shall not, is sufficient to
prevent it from being intended. So any genuine doubt as
to the existence of a circumstance, coupled with a genuine
hope that it does not exist, is enough to prevent the act from
being intentional as to that circumstance. The act may be
grossly negligent, it may be absolutely reckless, but it is not
intentional. If I fire a rifle at A., knowing that I may very
probably hit B. who is standing close to him, I do not for that
reason intend to hit B. I genuinely intend and desire not to
hit him. An intention to hit B. would be inconsistent with
my admitted intention to hit A.<a id='r342'></a><a href='#f342' class='c016'><sup>[342]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 134. <b>Intention and Motive.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>A wrongful act is seldom intended and desired for its own
sake. The wrongdoer has in view some ulterior object which
he desires to obtain by means of it. The evil which he does
to another, he does and desires only for the sake of some
resulting good which he will obtain for himself. He <em>intends</em>
the attainment of this ulterior object, no less than he intends
the wrongful act itself. His intent, therefore, is twofold, and
is divisible into two distinct portions, which we may distinguish
as his immediate and his ulterior intent. The former
is that which relates to the wrongful act itself; the latter is
that which passes beyond the wrongful act, and relates to the
object or series of objects for the sake of which the act is
done. The immediate intent of the thief is to appropriate
another person’s money, while his ulterior intent may be to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>buy food with it or to pay a debt. The ulterior intent is
called the <em>motive</em> of the act.</p>

<p class='c007'>The immediate intent is that part of the total intent which
is coincident with the wrongful act itself; the ulterior intent
or motive is that part of the total intent which lies outside
the boundaries of the wrongful act. For just as the act is
not necessarily confined within the limits of the intent, so the
intent is not necessarily confined within the limits of the act.
The wrongdoer’s immediate intent, if he has one, is his purpose
to <em>commit</em> the wrong; his ulterior intent, or motive, is
his purpose <em>in committing</em> it. Every wrongful act may raise
two distinct questions with respect to the intent of the doer.
The first of these is: <em>How</em> did he do the act—intentionally or
accidentally? The second is: If he did it intentionally, <em>why</em>
did he do it? The first is an inquiry into his immediate
intent; the second is concerned with his ulterior intent, or
motive.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ulterior intention of one wrongful act may be the commission
of another. I may make a die with intent to coin
bad money; I may coin bad money with intent to utter it;
I may utter it with intent to defraud. Each of these acts is
or may be a distinct criminal offence, and the intention of any
one of them is immediate with respect to that act itself, but
ulterior with respect to all that go before it in the series.</p>

<p class='c019'>A person’s ulterior intent may be complex instead of simple; he may
act from two or more concurrent motives instead of from one only. He
may institute a prosecution, partly from a desire to see justice done,
but partly also from ill-will towards the defendant. He may pay one of
his creditors preferentially on the eve of bankruptcy, partly from a desire
to benefit him at the expense of the others, and partly from a desire to gain
some advantage for himself. Now the law, as we shall see later, sometimes
makes liability for an act depend upon the motive with which it is done.
The Bankruptcy Act, for example, regards as fraudulent any payment
made by a debtor immediately before his bankruptcy with intent to prefer
one of his creditors to the others. In all such cases the presence of mixed or
concurrent motives raises a difficulty of interpretation. The phrase “with
intent to,” or its equivalents, may mean any one of at least four different
things:—(1) That the intent referred to must be the sole or exclusive intent;
(2) that it is sufficient if it is one of several concurrent intents; (3) that
it must be the chief or dominant intent, any others being subordinate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>or incidental; (4) that it must be a determining intent, that is to say, an
intent in the absence of which the act would not have been done, the
remaining purposes being insufficient motives by themselves. It is a
question of construction which of those meanings is the true one in the
particular case.<a id='r343'></a><a href='#f343' class='c016'><sup>[343]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 135. <b>Malice.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Closely connected with the law and theory of intentional
wrongdoing is the legal use of the word malice. In a narrow
and popular sense this term means ill-will, spite, or malevolence;
but its legal signification is much wider. Malice
means in law wrongful intention. It includes any intent
which the law deems wrongful, and which therefore serves as
a ground of liability. Any act done with such an intent is, in
the language of the law, malicious, and this legal usage has
etymology in its favour. The Latin <i><span lang="la">malitia</span></i><a id='r344'></a><a href='#f344' class='c016'><sup>[344]</sup></a> means badness,
physical or moral—wickedness in disposition or in conduct—not
specifically or exclusively ill-will or malevolence; hence
the malice of English law, including all forms of evil purpose,
design, intent, or motive.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have seen, however, that intent is of two kinds, being
either immediate or ulterior, the ulterior intent being commonly
distinguished as the motive. The term malice is
applied in law to both these forms of intent, and the result
is a somewhat puzzling ambiguity which requires careful
notice. When we say that an act is done maliciously, we
mean one of two distinct things. We mean either that it is
done intentionally, or that it is done with some wrongful
motive. In the phrases malicious homicide and malicious
injury to property, malicious is merely equivalent to wilful
or intentional. I burn down a house maliciously if I burn it
on purpose, but not if I burn it negligently. There is here no
reference to any ulterior purpose or motive. But on the
other hand malicious prosecution does not mean intentional
prosecution; it means a prosecution inspired by some motive
of which the law disapproves. A prosecution is malicious,
for example, if its ulterior intent is the extortion of money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>from the accused. So also with the malice which is needed
to make a man liable for defamation on a privileged occasion;
I do not utter defamatory statements maliciously, simply
because I utter them intentionally.<a id='r345'></a><a href='#f345' class='c016'><sup>[345]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>Although the word <i><span lang="la">malitia</span></i> is not unknown to the Roman lawyers, the
usual and technical name for wrongful intent is <i><span lang="la">dolus</span></i>, or more specifically
<i><span lang="la">dolus malus</span></i>. <i><span lang="la">Dolus</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">culpa</span></i> are the two forms of <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i>. In a narrower
sense, however, <i><span lang="la">dolus</span></i> includes merely that particular variety of wrongful
intent which we term fraud—that is to say, the intent to deceive.<a id='r346'></a><a href='#f346' class='c016'><sup>[346]</sup></a> From
this limited sense it was extended to cover all forms of wilful wrongdoing.
The English term fraud has never received an equally wide extension. It
resembles <i><span lang="la">dolus</span></i>, however, in having a double use. In its narrow sense it
means deceit, as we have just said, and is commonly opposed to force. In
a wider sense it includes all forms of dishonesty, that is to say, all wrongful
conduct inspired by a desire to derive profit from the injury of others. In
this sense fraud is commonly opposed to malice in its popular sense. I act
fraudulently when the motive of my wrongdoing is to derive some material
gain for myself, whether by way of deception, force, or otherwise. But I
act maliciously when my motive is the pleasure of doing harm to another,
rather than the acquisition of any advantage for myself. To steal property
is fraudulent; to damage or destroy it is malicious.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 136. <b>Relevance and Irrelevance of Motives.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We have already seen in what way and to what extent a
man’s immediate intent is material in a question of liability.
As a general rule no act is a sufficient basis of responsibility
unless it is done either wilfully or negligently. Intention
and negligence are the two alternative formal conditions of
penal liability.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have now to consider the relevance or materiality, not
of the immediate, but of the ulterior intent. To what extent
does the law take into account the motives of a wrongdoer?
To what extent will it inquire not merely what the defendant
has done, but why he has done it? To what extent is
malice, in the sense of improper motive, an element in legal
wrongdoing?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>In answer to this question we may say generally (subject
however, to very important qualifications) that in law a man’s
motives are irrelevant. As a general rule no act otherwise
lawful becomes unlawful because done with a bad motive;
and conversely no act otherwise unlawful is excused or justified
because of the motives of the doer, however good. The
law will judge a man by what he does, not by the reasons
for which he does it.</p>

<p class='c019'>“It is certainly,” says Lord Herschell,<a id='r347'></a><a href='#f347' class='c016'><sup>[347]</sup></a> “a general rule of our law that
an act <i><span lang="la">prima facie</span></i> lawful is not unlawful and actionable on account of the
motives which dictated it.” So it has been said:<a id='r348'></a><a href='#f348' class='c016'><sup>[348]</sup></a> “No use of property
which would be legal if due to a proper motive can become illegal because
it is prompted by a motive which is improper or even malicious.” “Much
more harm than good,” says Lord Macnaghten,<a id='r349'></a><a href='#f349' class='c016'><sup>[349]</sup></a> “would be done by encouraging
or permitting inquiries into motives when the immediate act
alleged to have caused the loss for which redress is sought is in itself innocent
or neutral in character and one which anybody may do or leave
undone without fear of legal consequences. Such an inquisition would I
think be intolerable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>An illustration of this irrelevance of motives is the right
of a landowner to do harm to adjoining proprietors in certain
defined ways by acts done on his own land. He may intercept
the access of light to his neighbour’s windows, or withdraw
by means of excavation the support which his land
affords to his neighbour’s house, or drain away the water
which would otherwise supply his neighbour’s well. His
right to do all these things depends in no way on the motive
with which he does them. The law cares nothing whether
his acts are inspired by an honest desire to improve his own
property, or by a malevolent impulse to damage that of
others. He may do as he pleases with his own.<a id='r350'></a><a href='#f350' class='c016'><sup>[350]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>To this rule as to the irrelevance of motives there are,
however, very important exceptions, more especially in the
criminal law. The chief of these are the following.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ 137. <b>Criminal Attempts.</b></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>An attempt to commit an indictable offence is itself a
crime. Every attempt is an act done with intent to commit
the offence so attempted. The existence of this ulterior intent
or motive is of the essence of the attempt. The act in
itself may be perfectly innocent, but is deemed criminal by
reason of the purpose with which it is done. To mix arsenic
in food is in itself a perfectly lawful act, for it may be that the
mixture is designed for the poisoning of rats. But if the purpose
is to kill a human being, the act becomes by reason of
this purpose the crime of attempted murder. In such cases
a rational system of law cannot avoid considering the motive
as material, for it is from the motive alone that the act derives
all its mischievous tendency, and therefore its wrongful
nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although every attempt is an act done with intent to commit
a crime, the converse is not true. Every act done with
this intent is not an attempt, for it may be too remote from
the completed offence to give rise to criminal liability, notwithstanding
the criminal purpose of the doer. I may buy
matches with intent to burn a haystack, and yet be clear of
attempted arson; but if I go to the stack and there light one
of the matches, my intent has developed into a criminal attempt.
To intend to commit a crime is one thing; to get
ready to commit it is another; to try to commit it is a third.
We may say, indeed, that every intentional crime involves
four distinct stages—Intention, Preparation, Attempt, and
Completion. The two former are commonly innocent. An
unacted intent is no more a ground of liability than is an unintended
act. The will and the deed must go together. Even
action in pursuance of the intent is not commonly criminal if
it goes no further than the stage of preparation. I may buy
a pistol with felonious purpose, and yet remain free from
legal guilt. There is still a <i><span lang="la">locus poenitentiae</span></i>. But the two
last stages in the offence, namely attempt and completion, are
grounds of legal liability. How, then, are we to draw the line
which thus separates innocence from guilt? What is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>distinction between preparing to commit a crime and
attempting to commit it? How far may a man go along the
path of his criminal intent, and yet turn back in safety if his
heart or the occasion fails him? This is a question to which
English law gives no definite or sufficient answer. “An
attempt to commit a crime,” says Sir James Stephen in his
Digest of the Criminal Law,<a id='r351'></a><a href='#f351' class='c016'><sup>[351]</sup></a> “is an act done with intent to
commit that crime, and forming part of a series of acts which
would constitute its actual commission, if it were not interrupted.
The point at which such a series of acts begins
cannot be defined, but depends upon the circumstances of
each particular case.” This, however, affords no adequate
guidance, and lays down no principle which would prevent a
conviction for attempted forgery on proof of the purchase of
ink and paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>The German Criminal Code,<a id='r352'></a><a href='#f352' class='c016'><sup>[352]</sup></a> on the other hand, defines an
attempt as an act done with intent to commit a crime, and
amounting to the commencement of the execution of it. That
is to say, an act is not an attempt unless it forms a constituent
part of the completed crime. Otherwise it is merely preparatory.
It may be doubted, however, whether this is a
sufficient solution of the problem. We know when a crime is
completed, but at what stage in the long series of preliminary
acts does it begin? Not later, it would seem, than
the earliest act done with the requisite criminal intent; yet
this act may be far too remote to constitute an attempt.</p>

<p class='c006'>What, then, is the true principle? The question is a difficult
one, but the following answer may be suggested. An
attempt is an act of such a nature that it is itself evidence
of the criminal intent with which it is done. A criminal
attempt bears criminal intent upon its face. <i><span lang="la">Res ipsa
loquitur.</span></i> An act, on the other hand, which is in itself and on
the face of it innocent, is not a criminal attempt, and cannot
be made punishable by evidence <i><span lang="la">aliunde</span></i> as to the purpose
with which it was done. To buy matches with intent to commit
arson is not attempted arson, because the act is innocent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>on its face, there being many lawful reasons for the purchase
of matches. But to buy dies with intent to coin money is
attempted forgery, for the act speaks for itself.<a id='r353'></a><a href='#f353' class='c016'><sup>[353]</sup></a> For the
same reason, to buy or load a gun with murderous intent is
not in ordinary circumstances attempted murder; but to lie
in wait with the loaded weapon, or to present it, or discharge
it, is an act which itself proclaims the criminal purpose with
which it is done, and it is punishable accordingly. If this is
the correct explanation of the matter, the ground of the distinction
between preparation and attempt is evidential merely.
The reason for holding a man innocent, who does an act with
intent to commit a crime, is the danger involved in the admission
of evidence upon which persons may be punished for
acts which in themselves and in appearance are perfectly
innocent. <i><span lang="la">Cogitationis poenam nemo patitur.</span></i> No man can be
safely punished for his guilty purposes, save so far as they
have manifested themselves in overt acts which themselves
proclaim his guilt.</p>

<p class='c019'>There is yet another difficulty in the theory of attempts. What shall
be said if the act done with intent to commit a crime is of such a nature
that the completion of the crime by such means is impossible: as if I
attempt to steal by putting my hand into an empty pocket, or to poison
by administering sugar which I believe to be arsenic? It was long
supposed to be the law of England that there could be no conviction for
an attempt in such cases. It was considered that an attempt must be
part of a series of acts and events which, in its completeness, would
actually constitute the offence attempted.<a id='r354'></a><a href='#f354' class='c016'><sup>[354]</sup></a> Recent decisions have determined
the law otherwise.<a id='r355'></a><a href='#f355' class='c016'><sup>[355]</sup></a> The possibility of a successful issue is not a
necessary element in an attempt, and this conclusion seems sound in
principle. The matter, however, is not free from difficulty, since it may
be argued on the other side that acts which in their nature cannot result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>in any harm are not mischievous either in their tendency or in their results,
and therefore should not be treated as crimes. Shall an attempt to procure
the death of one’s enemy by means of witchcraft be punished as
attempted murder?</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 138. <b>Other Exceptions to the Irrelevance of Motives.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Criminal attempts constitute, as we have seen, the first of
the exceptions to the rule that a person’s ulterior intent or
motive is irrelevant in law. A second exception comprises
all those cases in which a particular intent forms part of the
definition of a criminal offence. Burglary, for example, consists
in breaking and entering a dwelling-house by night with
intent to commit a felony therein. So forgery consists in
making a false document with intent to defraud. In all such
instances the ulterior intent is the source, in whole or in part,
of the mischievous tendency of the act, and is therefore
material in law.</p>

<p class='c007'>In civil as opposed to criminal liability the ulterior intent
is very seldom relevant. In almost all cases the law looks to
the act alone, and makes no inquiries into the motives from
which it proceeds. There are, however, certain exceptions
even in the civil law, and the chief, if not all, of these fall
within the principle that a harmful act may be <i><span lang="la">damnum sine
injuria</span></i> if done from a proper motive and without malice, but
loses this protection so soon as it proceeds from some motive
of which the law does not approve. It may be expedient in
the public interest to allow certain specified kinds of harm to
be done to individuals, so long as they are done for some good
and sufficient reason; but the ground of this privilege falls
away so soon as it is abused for bad ends. In such cases,
therefore, malice is an essential element in the cause of action.
Examples of wrongs of this class are defamation (in cases of
privilege) and malicious prosecution. In these instances the
plaintiff must prove malice, because in all of them the defendant’s
act is one which falls under the head of <i><span lang="la">damnum
sine injuria</span></i> so long, but so long only, as it is done with good
intent.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ 139. <b><span lang="la">Jus necessitatis.</span></b></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>We shall conclude our examination of the theory of wilful
wrongdoing by considering a special case in which, although
intention is present, the <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i> is nevertheless absent. This
is the case of the <i><span lang="la">jus necessitatis</span></i>. So far as the abstract
theory of responsibility is concerned, an act which is necessary
is not wrongful, even though done with full and deliberate
intention. It is a familiar proverb that necessity
knows no law: <i><span lang="la">Necessitas non habet legem</span></i>. By necessity is
here meant the presence of some motive adverse to the law,
and of such exceeding strength as to overcome any fear that
can be inspired by the threat of legal penalties. The <i><span lang="la">jus
necessitatis</span></i> is the right of a man to do that from which he cannot
be dissuaded by any terror of legal punishment. Where
threats are necessarily ineffective, they should not be made,
and their fulfilment is the infliction of needless and uncompensated
evil.</p>

<p class='c006'>The common illustration of this right of necessity is the
case of two drowning men clinging to a plank that will not
support more than one of them. It may be the moral duty
of him who has no one dependent on him to sacrifice himself
for the other who is a husband or a father; it may be the
moral duty of the old to give way to the young. But it is idle
for the law to lay down any other rule save this, that it is the
right of the stronger to use his strength for his own preservation.
Another familiar case of necessity is that in which
shipwrecked sailors are driven to choose between death by
starvation on the one side and murder and cannibalism on the
other. A third case is that of crime committed under the
pressure of illegal threats of death or grievous bodily harm.
“If,” says Hobbes,<a id='r356'></a><a href='#f356' class='c016'><sup>[356]</sup></a> “a man by the terror of present death
be compelled to do a fact against the law, he is totally
excused; because no law can oblige a man to abandon his
own preservation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It is to be noticed that the test of necessity is not the powerlessness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>of any possible, but that of any reasonable punishment.
It is enough if the lawless motives to an act will
necessarily countervail the fear of any penalty which it is just
and expedient that the law should threaten. If burning
alive were a fit and proper punishment for petty theft, the
fear of it would probably prevent a starving wretch from
stealing a crust of bread; and the <i><span lang="la">jus necessitatis</span></i> would have
no place. But we cannot place the rights of property at so
high a level. There are cases, therefore, in which the motives
to crime cannot be controlled by any reasonable punishment.
In such cases an essential element of the <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i>, namely
freedom of choice, is absent; and so far as abstract theory is
concerned, there is no sufficient basis of legal liability.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a matter of practice, however, evidential difficulties prevent
any but the most limited scope being permitted to the
<i><span lang="la">jus necessitatis</span></i>. In how few cases can we say with any approach
to certainty that the possibility of self-control is really
absent, that there is no true choice between good and evil,
and that the deed is one for which the doer is rightly irresponsible.
In this conflict between the requirements of
theory and the difficulties of practice the law has resorted to
compromise. While in some few instances necessity is admitted
as a ground of excuse, it is in most cases regarded as
relevant to the measure rather than to the existence of liability.
It is acknowledged as a reason for the reduction of
the penalty, even to a nominal amount, but not for its total
remission. Homicide in the blind fury of irresistible passion
is not innocent, but neither is it murder; it is reduced to the
lower level of manslaughter. Shipwrecked sailors who kill
and eat their comrades to save their own lives are in law guilty
of murder itself; but the clemency of the Crown will commute
the capital sentence to a short term of imprisonment.<a id='r357'></a><a href='#f357' class='c016'><sup>[357]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 140. <b>Negligence.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We have considered the first of the three classes into which
injuries are divisible, namely those which are intentional or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>wilful, and we have now to deal with the second, namely
wrongs of negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The term negligence has two uses, for it signifies sometimes
a particular state of mind, and at other times conduct
resulting therefrom. In the former or subjective sense, negligence
is opposed to wrongful intention, these being the two
forms assumed by that <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i> which is a condition of penal
responsibility. In the latter or objective sense, it is opposed
not to wrongful intention, but to intentional wrongdoing. A
similar double signification is observable in other words.
Cruelty, for example, means subjectively a certain disposition
and objectively conduct resulting from it. The ambiguity
can scarcely lead to any confusion, for the two forms of negligence
are necessarily coincident. Objective negligence is
merely subjective negligence realised in conduct; and subjective
negligence is of no account in the law, until and unless
it is manifested in act. We shall commonly use the term
in the subjective sense, and shall speak objectively not of
negligence, but of negligent conduct or negligent wrongdoing.<a id='r358'></a><a href='#f358' class='c016'><sup>[358]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Negligence is culpable carelessness. “It is,” says Willes,
J.,<a id='r359'></a><a href='#f359' class='c016'><sup>[359]</sup></a> “the absence of such care as it was the duty of the defendant
to use.” What then is meant by carelessness? It
is clear, in the first place, that it excludes wrongful intention.
These are two contrasted and mutually inconsistent
mental attitudes of a person towards his acts and their consequences.
No result which is due to carelessness can have
been also intended. Nothing which was intended can have
been due to carelessness.<a id='r360'></a><a href='#f360' class='c016'><sup>[360]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be observed, in the second place, that carelessness
or negligence does not necessarily consist in thoughtlessness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>or inadvertence. This is doubtless the commonest form of it,
but it is not the only form. If I do harm, not because I
intended it, but because I was thoughtless and did not advert
to the dangerous nature of my act, or foolishly believed that
there was no danger, I am certainly guilty of negligence. But
there is another form of negligence, in which there is no
thoughtlessness or inadvertence whatever. If I drive
furiously down a crowded street, I may be fully conscious of
the serious risk to which I expose other persons. I may not
intend to injure any of them, but I knowingly and intentionally
expose them to the danger. Yet if a fatal accident
happens, I am liable, at the most, not for wilful, but for negligent
homicide. When I consciously expose another to the
risk of wrongful harm, but without any wish to harm him,
and harm actually ensues, it is inflicted not wilfully, since it
was not desired, nor inadvertently, since it was foreseen as
possible or even probable, but nevertheless negligently.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, then, negligence or carelessness is not to be identified
with thoughtlessness or inadvertence, what is its essential
nature? The correct answer seems to be that a careless
person is a person who does not <em>care</em>. The essence of negligence
is not inadvertence but <em>indifference</em>. Indifference is
exceedingly apt to produce thoughtlessness or inadvertence;
but it is not the same thing, and may exist without it, as we
have seen from the example already given. If I am careless,
that is to say indifferent, as to the results of my conduct, I
shall very probably fail to acquire adequate foresight and consciousness
of them; but I may, on the contrary, make a
very accurate estimate of them, and yet remain equally
indifferent with respect to them, and therefore equally
negligent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Negligence, therefore, essentially consists in the <em>mental
attitude of undue indifference with respect to one’s conduct and
its consequences</em>.<a id='r361'></a><a href='#f361' class='c016'><sup>[361]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>This being so, the distinction between intention and
negligence becomes clear. The wilful wrongdoer desires the
harmful consequences, and therefore does the act in order
that they may ensue. The negligent wrongdoer is careless
(if not wholly, yet unduly) whether they ensue or not, and
therefore does the act not withstanding the risk that they may
ensue. The wilful wrongdoer is liable because he desires to
do the harm; the negligent wrongdoer is liable because he
does not sufficiently desire to avoid it. He who will excuse
himself on the ground that he meant no evil is still open to the
reply: Perhaps you did not, but at all events you might have
avoided it, if you had sufficiently desired so to do; and you
are held liable not because you desired the mischief, but because
you were careless and indifferent whether it ensued or
not.</p>

<p class='c007'>Negligence, as so defined, is rightly treated as a form of
<i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i>, standing side by side with wrongful intention as a
formal ground of responsibility. For these are the two
mental attitudes which alone justify the discipline of penal
justice. The law may rightly punish wilful wrongdoing,
because, since the wrongdoer desired the outcome of his act,
punishment will supply him for the future with a good reason
for desiring the opposite. So, also, the law may justly punish
negligent wrongdoing, for since the wrongdoer is careless as
to the interests of others, punishment will cure this defect by
making those interests for the future coincident with his own.
In no other case than these two can punishment be effective,
and therefore in no other case is it justifiable. So far as
abstract theory is concerned, every man is exempt from penal
responsibility who can truly say: The harm which I have
done is not the outcome of any desire of mine to do it; neither
does it proceed from any carelessness or indifference as to
my acts and the results of them; I did not mean it, neither
could I have avoided it by care.</p>

<p class='c007'>It follows from the foregoing analysis that negligence is
of two kinds, according as it is or is not accompanied by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>inadvertence. Advertent negligence is commonly termed
wilful negligence or recklessness. Inadvertent negligence
may be distinguished as simple. In the former the harm done
is foreseen as possible or probable, but it is not willed. In
the latter it is neither foreseen nor willed. In each case
carelessness, that is to say, indifference as to consequences, is
present; but in the former case this indifference does not,
while in the latter it does prevent these consequences from
being foreseen. The physician who treats a patient improperly
through ignorance or forgetfulness is guilty of simple
or inadvertent negligence; but if he does the same in order
to save himself trouble, or by way of a scientific experiment,
with full recognition of the dangers so incurred, his negligence
is wilful.<a id='r362'></a><a href='#f362' class='c016'><sup>[362]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This distinction is of little practical importance, but
demands recognition here, partly because of the false opinion
that all negligence is inadvertent, and partly because of the
puzzling nature of the expression wilful negligence. In view
of the fundamental opposition between intention and negligence,
this expression looks at first sight self-contradictory,
but it is not so. He who does a dangerous act, well knowing
that he is exposing others to a serious risk of injury, and
thereby causes a fatal accident, is guilty of negligent, not of
wilful homicide. But the negligence is wilful, though the
homicide is not. He is not merely negligent, but consciously,
wilfully, and intentionally negligent; for he knows at the
time the true nature of the act which he is doing. It is
intentional with respect to the fact that his mental attitude
towards the consequences is one of culpable indifference.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 141. <b>Objection Considered.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>By way of objection to the foregoing analysis it may be
said: “It is not true that in all cases negligence amounts to
carelessness in the sense of indifference. A drunken man is
liable for negligence if he stumbles as he walks along the
street, and breaks a shop window, but he may have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>exceedingly anxious to walk in a straight line and to avoid
any such accident. He may have been conscientiously using
his best endeavours, but they will not serve to justify him
on a charge of negligence. So an unskilful physician may
devote to the treatment and cure of his patient an amount
of anxious attention and strenuous endeavour, far in excess
of that which one more skilful would consider necessary; yet
if his treatment is wrong, he is guilty of negligence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The answer to this objection is that in these and all similar
cases carelessness in the sense of indifference is really present,
though it is remote instead of immediate. The drunken man
may be anxious and careful <em>now</em> not to break other persons’
windows, but if he had been sufficiently anxious and careful
on the point some time ago, he would have remained sober,
and the accident would not have happened. So with the
unskilful physician. It is a settled principle of law that want
of skill or of professional competence amounts to negligence.
<i><span lang="la">Imperitia culpae adnumeratur.</span></i><a id='r363'></a><a href='#f363' class='c016'><sup>[363]</sup></a> He who will exercise any
trade or profession must bring to the exercise of it such a
measure of skill and knowledge as will suffice for reasonable
efficiency, and he who has less than this practises at his own
risk. The ignorant physician who kills his patient, or the
unskilful blacksmith who lames the horse shod by him, is
legally responsible, not because he is ignorant or unskilful—for
skill and knowledge may be beyond his reach—but because,
being unskilful or ignorant, he ventures to undertake a
business which calls for qualities which he does not possess.
No man is bound in law to be a good surgeon or a capable
attorney, but all men are bound not to act as surgeons or
attorneys until and unless they are good and capable as such.</p>

<p class='c007'>The unskilful physician, therefore, is liable not because he
is now careless of the health of his patient, but because he
was formerly careless in undertaking work calling for greater
skill than he possessed. If he then knew that he had not
the requisite skill, his carelessness is obvious. Possibly,
however, he believed himself to be sufficiently qualified. In
this case we must go one step further back in the search for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>that mental attitude of indifference which is the essential
element in all cases of negligence. He was careless in forming
his beliefs; he formed them without that anxious consideration
which the law requires from those who form beliefs on
which they act to the injury of others. A man may be called
upon by the law to answer to-day for the carelessness with
which he formed an opinion years ago.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 142. <b>The Standard of Care.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Carelessness is not culpable, or a ground of legal liability,
save in those cases in which the law has imposed a duty of
carefulness. In all other cases complete indifference as to the
interests of others is allowable. No general principle can be
laid down, however, with regard to the existence of this duty,
for this is a matter pertaining to the details of the concrete
legal system, and not to abstract theory. Carelessness is
lawful or unlawful, as the law sees fit to provide. In the
criminal law liability for negligence is quite exceptional.
Speaking generally, crimes are wilful wrongs, the alternative
form of <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i> being deemed an insufficient ground for the
rigour of criminal justice. This, however, is not invariably
the case, negligent homicide, for example, being a criminal
offence. In the civil law, on the other hand, no such distinction
is commonly drawn between the two forms of <i><span lang="la">mens
rea</span></i>. In general we may say that whenever an act would be
a civil wrong if done intentionally, it is also a civil wrong if
done negligently. When there is a legal duty not to do a
thing on purpose, there is commonly a legal duty to take
care not to do it accidentally. To this rule, however, there
are certain exceptions—instances in which wrongful intent
is the necessary basis even of civil liability. In these cases
a person is civilly responsible for doing harm wilfully, but is
not bound to take any care not to do it. He must not, for
example, deceive another by any wilful falsehood, but unless
there is some special ground of obligation in the case, he is
not answerable for false statements which he honestly believes
to be true, however negligent he may be in making them.<a id='r364'></a><a href='#f364' class='c016'><sup>[364]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>Other instances of the same sort are based upon the express
or implied agreement or understanding of the persons concerned.
Thus the gratuitous lender of a chattel is bound to
disclose any dangerous defects which he actually knows of,
but is not bound to take any care whatever to see that it is
safe, or to discover and disclose defects of which he is ignorant.
For he who borrows a thing gratuitously agrees impliedly to
take it as it is, and to run all risks. But he who hires a
thing for money is entitled to the exercise of due care for his
safety on the part of the owner.<a id='r365'></a><a href='#f365' class='c016'><sup>[365]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Carelessness may exist in any degree, and in this respect
it differs from the other form of <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i>. Intention either
exists or it does not; there can be no question of the degree in
which it is present. The degree of carelessness varies directly
with the risk to which other persons are exposed by the act
in question. He is careless, who, without intending evil,
nevertheless exposes others to the danger of it, and the
greater the danger the greater the carelessness. The risk
depends, in its turn, on two things: first, the magnitude of
the threatened evil, and second, the probability of it. The
greater the evil is, and the nearer it is, the greater is the
indifference or carelessness of him who creates the danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inasmuch, therefore, as carelessness varies in degree, it is
necessary to know what degree of it is requisite to constitute
culpable negligence. What measure of care does the law
demand? What amount of anxious consideration for the
interests of others is a legal duty, and within what limits is
indifference lawful?</p>

<p class='c007'>We have first to notice a possible standard of care which
the law might have adopted but has not. It does not demand
the highest degree of care of which human nature is
capable. I am not liable for harm ignorantly done by me,
merely because by some conceivable exercise of prudential
foresight I might have anticipated the event and so avoided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>it. Nor am I liable because, knowing the possibility of harm,
I fail to take every possible precaution against it. The law
demands not that which is possible, but that which is reasonable
in view of the magnitude of the risk. Were men to act
on any other principle than this, excess of caution would
paralyse the business of the world. The law, therefore,
allows every man to expose his fellows to a certain measure of
risk, and to do so even with full knowledge. If an explosion
occurs in my powder mill, I am not liable for negligence, even
though I established and carried on the industry with full
knowledge of its dangerous character. This is a degree of
indifference to the safety of other men’s lives and property
which the law deems permissible because not excessive. Inasmuch
as the carrying of firearms and the driving of horses
are known to be the occasions of frequent harm, extreme care
and the most scrupulous anxiety as to the interests of others
would prompt a man to abstain from those dangerous forms
of activity. Yet it is expedient in the public interest that
those activities should go on, and therefore that men should
be exposed to the incidental risks of them. Consequently
the law does not insist on any standard of care which would
include them within the limits of culpable negligence. It is
for the law to draw the line as best it can, so that while prohibiting
unreasonable carelessness, it does not at the same
time demand unreasonable care.</p>

<p class='c007'>What standard, then, does the law actually adopt? It
demands the amount of care which would be shown in the
circumstances of the particular case by an ordinarily careful
man. It is content to adopt the standard which is customary
for the time being in the community. It is satisfied
with conduct which in point of carefulness conforms to the
moral standard and the ordinary practice of mankind. Less
than this is not sufficient, and more than this is not required.
A jury in determining the question of negligence will decide
whether in their opinion the defendant acted with reasonable
care; and in so doing they represent and express the current
opinion and practice of the community as to the risks to
which one man is justified in exposing others, and as to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>degree of consideration for the welfare of others which the
community exacts and commonly receives from its members.</p>

<p class='c007'>The standard thus adopted by the law is of necessity somewhat
vague and indeterminate. It is not practicable to any
great extent to lay down any more definite and detailed rules
as to what classes of acts are negligent and what are not. Too
much depends upon the circumstances of the individual
case, and the standard of due care is too liable to alter with
the advance of knowledge and the changes of social life and
manners. Risks which were once deemed excessive may
become permissible in view of the increasing stress and hurry
of modern life, and conversely conduct which to-day is beyond
reproach may in the future become grossly negligent by
reason of the growth of skill or knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, here as elsewhere, the law seeks for definite
and specific principles. It dislikes the licence of the <i><span lang="la">arbitrium
judicis</span></i>. So far as practicable and justifiable it desires to
make negligence a matter not of fact but of legal rule and
definition. It seeks to supersede the vague principle that
that is negligence which a jury considers such, by substituting
for it a body of legal doctrine determining the boundaries of
negligence in specific instances. This, however, is possible
only to a very limited extent. It would seem, indeed, that
all legal rules on this matter are merely negative, determining
what does not amount to negligence, and never positive, determining
that certain acts are negligent in law. It has been
decided as a matter of law, for example, that it is not negligent
to drive cattle through the streets of a town loose instead of
leading them with halters.<a id='r366'></a><a href='#f366' class='c016'><sup>[366]</sup></a> Nor is it negligent to allow a
dog to run at large, if the owner has no actual knowledge
of its vicious temper. Nor is it negligent to try a horse for
the first time in a frequented thoroughfare.<a id='r367'></a><a href='#f367' class='c016'><sup>[367]</sup></a> Nor is there
any negligence in the usual practice of railway servants
in violently shutting the doors of railway carriages without
warning,<a id='r368'></a><a href='#f368' class='c016'><sup>[368]</sup></a> notwithstanding the risk of injury to the hands of
passengers.<a id='r369'></a><a href='#f369' class='c016'><sup>[369]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>As has been already indicated, there seem to be no corresponding
rules to the effect that certain kinds of conduct are
negligent in law. The law never goes further in this direction
than to say that certain facts are sufficient <em>evidence</em> of negligence,
that is to say, are sufficient to entitle the jury to find
negligence as a matter of fact if they think fit. The reason
for this cautious attitude of the law is obvious. No facts can
be such cogent proof of negligence that the law may safely
and wisely take them as conclusive. For they may be
capable of explanation by other facts, and that which is
apparently due to the most culpable negligence may be due in
reality to inevitable mistake or accident. Thus the law does
not contain any rule to the effect that driving on the wrong
side of the road amounts to negligence. The rule is merely
that such conduct is evidence of negligence.<a id='r370'></a><a href='#f370' class='c016'><sup>[370]</sup></a> Nor is the act
of leaving a horse and cart unattended in the street an act of
negligence in law; it is merely one from which a jury is at
liberty to infer negligence in fact.<a id='r371'></a><a href='#f371' class='c016'><sup>[371]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 143. <b>Degrees of Negligence.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We have said that English law recognises only one standard
of care and therefore only one degree of negligence. Whenever
a person is under a duty to take any care at all, he is
bound to take that amount of it which is deemed reasonable
under the circumstances, having regard to the ordinary practice
of mankind; and the absence of this care is culpable
negligence. Although this is probably a correct statement
of English law, attempts have been made to establish two or
even three distinct standards of care and degrees of negligence.
Some authorities, for example, distinguish between
gross negligence (<i><span lang="la">culpa lata</span></i>) and slight negligence (<i><span lang="la">culpa
levis</span></i>), holding that a person is sometimes liable for the former
only, and at other times even for the latter. In some cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>we find even a threefold distinction maintained, negligence
being either gross, ordinary, or slight.<a id='r372'></a><a href='#f372' class='c016'><sup>[372]</sup></a> These distinctions
are based partly upon Roman law, and partly upon a misunderstanding
of it, and notwithstanding some judicial dicta
to the contrary we may say with some confidence that no such
doctrine is known to the law of England.<a id='r373'></a><a href='#f373' class='c016'><sup>[373]</sup></a> These distinctions
so drawn are hopelessly indeterminate and impracticable.
On what principle are we to draw the line between gross
negligence and slight? How can we thus elevate a distinction
of degree into one of kind? Even were it possible to
establish two or more standards, there seems no reason of
justice or expediency for doing so. The single standard of
English law is sufficient for all cases. Why should any man
be required to show more care than is reasonable under the
circumstances, or excused if he shows less?</p>

<p class='c007'>In connection with this alleged distinction between gross
and slight negligence it is necessary to consider the celebrated
doctrine of Roman law to the effect that the former (<i><span lang="la">culpa
lata</span></i>) is equivalent to wrongful intention (<i><span lang="la">dolus</span></i>)—a principle
which receives occasional expression and recognition in
English law also. <i><span lang="la">Magna culpa dolus est</span></i>,<a id='r374'></a><a href='#f374' class='c016'><sup>[374]</sup></a> said the Romans.
In its literal interpretation, indeed, this is untrue, for we have
already seen that the two forms of <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i> are wholly inconsistent
with each other, and that no degree of carelessness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>can amount to design or purpose. Yet the proposition,
though inaccurately expressed, has a true signification.
Although <em>real</em> negligence, however gross, cannot amount to
intention, <em>alleged</em> negligence may. Alleged negligence which,
if real, would be exceedingly gross, is probably not negligence
at all, but wrongful purpose. Its grossness raises a presumption
against its reality. For we have seen that carelessness
is measured by the magnitude and imminence of the
threatened mischief. Now the greater and more imminent
the mischief, the more probable is it that it is intended.
Genuine indifference and carelessness is very unusual and
unlikely in extreme cases. Men are often enough indifferent
as to remote or unimportant dangers to which they expose
others, but serious risks are commonly avoided by care unless
the mischief is desired and intended. The probability of a
result tends to prove intention and therefore to disprove
negligence. If a new-born child is left to die from want of
medical attention or nursing, it <em>may</em> be that its death is due
to negligence only, but it is more probable that it is due to
wrongful purpose and malice aforethought. He who strikes
another on the head with an iron bar <em>may</em> have meant only
to wound or stun, and not to kill him, but the probabilities
are the other way. Every man is presumed to intend the
natural and probable consequences of his acts,<a id='r375'></a><a href='#f375' class='c016'><sup>[375]</sup></a> and the more
natural and probable the consequences, the greater the
strength of the presumption.<a id='r376'></a><a href='#f376' class='c016'><sup>[376]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In certain cases this presumption of intent has hardened
into a positive rule of law, and has become irrebuttable. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>those cases that which is negligence in fact may be deemed
wrongful intent in law. It is constructive, though not actual
intent. The law of homicide supplies us with an illustration.
Murder is wilful homicide, and manslaughter is negligent
homicide, but the boundary line as drawn by the law is not
fully coincident with that which exists in fact. Much that
is merely negligent in fact is treated as wilful homicide in
law. An intent to cause grievous bodily harm is imputed
as an intent to kill, if death ensues, and an act done with
knowledge that it will probably cause death is in law an act
done with intent to cause it.<a id='r377'></a><a href='#f377' class='c016'><sup>[377]</sup></a> The justification of such conclusive
presumptions of intent is twofold. In the first place,
as already indicated, very gross negligence is probably in
truth not negligence at all, but wrongful purpose; and in the
second place, even if it is truly negligence, yet by reason of
its grossness it is as bad as intent, in point of moral deserts,
and therefore may justly be treated and punished as if it were
intent. The law, accordingly, will sometimes say to a defendant:
“Perhaps, as you allege, you were merely negligent,
and had no actual wrongful purpose; nevertheless you will
be dealt with just as if you had, and it will be conclusively
presumed against you that your act was wilful. For your
deserts are no better than if you had in truth intended the
mischief which you have so recklessly caused. Moreover it
is exceedingly probable, notwithstanding your disclaimer,
that you did indeed intend it; therefore no endeavour will be
made on your behalf to discover whether you did or not.”</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 144. <b>Other Theories of Negligence.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The analysis of the conception of negligence is a matter
of some considerable difficulty, and it is advisable to take
account of certain theories which differ more or less seriously
from that which has been here accepted by us.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is held by some, that negligence consists essentially in
inadvertence. It consists, that is to say, in a failure to be
alert, circumspect, or vigilant, whereby the true nature, circumstances,
and consequences of a man’s acts are prevented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>from being present in his consciousness. The wilful wrongdoer
is lie who knows that his act is wrong; the negligent
wrongdoer is he who does not know it, but would have known
it, were it not for his mental indolence.<a id='r378'></a><a href='#f378' class='c016'><sup>[378]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This explanation contains an important element of the
truth, but it is inadequate. For in the first place, as has been
already pointed out, all negligence is not inadvertent. There
is such a thing as wilful or advertent negligence, in which
the wrongdoer knows perfectly well the true nature, circumstances,
and probable consequences of his act. He foresees
those consequences, and yet does not intend them, and therefore
cannot be charged with wilful wrongdoing in respect of
them. His mental attitude with regard to them is not
intention, but a genuine form of negligence, of which the
theory of inadvertence can give no explanation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the second place, all inadvertence is not negligence. A
failure to appreciate the nature of one’s act, and to foresee its
consequences, is not in itself culpable. It is no ground of
responsibility, unless it is due to carelessness in the sense of
undue indifference. He who is ignorant or forgetful, notwithstanding
a genuine desire to attain knowledge or remembrance,
is not negligent. The signalman who sleeps at his
post is negligent, not because he falls asleep, but because he
is not sufficiently anxious to remain awake. If his sleep is
the unavoidable result of illness or excessive labour, he is free
from blame. The essence of negligence, therefore, is not inadvertence—which
may or may not be due to carelessness—but
carelessness—which may or may not result in inadvertence.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be suggested in defence of the theory of inadvertence
that there are in reality three forms of the <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i>,
and not two only: namely, (1) intention, when the consequences
are foreseen and intended, (2) recklessness, when
they are foreseen but not intended, and (3) negligence, when
they are neither foreseen nor intended. The law, however,
rightly classes the second and third of these together under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>the head of negligence, for they are identical in their essential
nature, each of them being blameworthy only so far as it is
the outcome of carelessness.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have now to consider another explanation which may
be termed the objective theory of negligence. It is held by
some that negligence is not a subjective, but an objective fact.
It is not a particular state of mind or form of the <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i> at
all, but a particular kind of conduct. It is a breach of the
duty of taking care, and to take care means to take precautions
against the harmful results of one’s actions, and to
refrain from unreasonably dangerous kinds of conduct.<a id='r379'></a><a href='#f379' class='c016'><sup>[379]</sup></a> To
drive at night without lights is negligence, because to carry
lights is a precaution taken by all reasonable and prudent
men for the avoidance of accidents. To take care, therefore,
is no more a mental attitude or state of mind than to take cold
is. This, however, is not a correct analysis. Carelessness
may <em>result</em> in a failure to take necessary precautions, or to
refrain from dangerous activities, but it is not the same
thing, just as it may result in inadvertence but is not the
same thing. The neglect of needful precautions or the doing
of unreasonably dangerous acts is not necessarily wrongful at
all, for it may be due to inevitable mistake or accident. And
on the other hand, even when it is wrongful, it may be wilful
instead of negligent. A trap door may be left unbolted, in
order that one’s enemy may fall through it and so die.
Poison may be left unlabelled, with intent that some one
may drink it by mistake. A ship captain may wilfully cast
away his ship by the neglect of the ordinary rules of good
seamanship. A father who neglects to provide medicine
for his sick child may be guilty of wilful murder, rather than
of mere negligence. In none of these cases, nor indeed in
any others, can we distinguish between intentional and
negligent wrongdoing, save by looking into the mind of the
offender, and observing his subjective attitude towards his
act and its consequences. Externally and objectively, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>two classes of offences are indistinguishable. Negligence is
the opposite of wrongful intention, and since the latter is a
subjective fact the former must be such also.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 145. <b>Wrongs of Absolute Liability.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We now proceed to consider the third class of wrongs, namely
those of absolute liability. These are the acts for which a
man is responsible irrespective of the existence of either
wrongful intent or negligence. They are the exceptions to
the rule, <i><span lang="la">Actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea</span></i>. It may be
thought, indeed, that in the civil as opposed to the criminal
law, absolute liability should be the rule rather than the
exception. It may be said: “It is clear that in the criminal
law liability should in all ordinary cases be based upon the
existence of <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i>. No man should be punished criminally
unless he knew that he was doing wrong, or might have
known it by taking care. Inevitable mistake or accident
should be a good defence for him. But why should the same
principle apply to civil liability? If I do another man harm,
why should I not be made to pay for it? What does it
matter to him whether I did it wilfully, or negligently, or by
inevitable accident? In either case I have actually done the
harm, and therefore should be bound to <em>undo</em> it by paying
compensation. For the essential aim of civil proceedings is
redress for harm suffered by the plaintiff, not punishment
for wrong done by the defendant; therefore the rule of <i><span lang="la">mens
rea</span></i> should be deemed inapplicable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is clear, however, that this is not the law of England, and
it seems equally clear that there is no sufficient reason why
it should be. In all those judicial proceedings which fall
under the head of penal redress, the determining purpose of
the law is not redress, but punishment. Redress is in those
cases merely the instrument of punishment. In itself it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>not a sufficient ground or justification for such proceedings at
all. Unless damages are at the same time a deserved penalty
inflicted upon the defendant, they are not to be justified as
being a deserved recompense awarded to the plaintiff. For
they in no way undo the wrong or restore the former state of
things. The wrong is done and cannot be undone. If by
accident I burn down another man’s house, the only result of
enforcing compensation is that the loss has been transferred
from him to me; but it remains as great as ever for all that.
The mischief done has been in no degree abated. If I am
not in fault, there is no more reason why I should insure
other persons against the harmful issues of my own activity,
than why I should insure them against lightning or earthquakes.
Unless some definite gain is to be derived by transferring
loss from one head to another, sound reason, as well
as the law, requires that the loss should lie where it falls.<a id='r380'></a><a href='#f380' class='c016'><sup>[380]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Although the requirement of <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i> is general throughout
the civil and criminal law, there are numerous exceptions
to it. The considerations on which these are based are
various, but the most important is the difficulty of procuring
adequate proof of intention or negligence. In the majority
of instances, indeed, justice requires that this difficulty be
honestly faced; but in certain special cases it is allowable to
circumvent it by means of a conclusive presumption of the
presence of this condition of liability. In this way we shall
certainly punish some who are innocent, but in the case of
civil liability this is not a very serious matter—since men
know that in such cases they act at their peril, and are content
to take the risk—while in respect of criminal liability
such a presumption is seldom resorted to, and only in the case
of comparatively trivial offences.<a id='r381'></a><a href='#f381' class='c016'><sup>[381]</sup></a> Whenever, therefore,
the strict doctrine of <i><span lang="la">mens rea</span></i> would too seriously interfere
with the administration of justice by reason of the evidential
difficulties involved in it, the law tends to establish a form of
absolute liability.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>In proceeding to consider the chief instances of this kind
of liability we find that the matter falls into three divisions,
namely—(1) Mistake of Law, (2) Mistake of Fact, and
(3) Accident.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 146. <b>Mistake of Law.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>It is a principle recognised not only by our own but by
other legal systems that ignorance of the law is no excuse
for breaking it. <i><span lang="la">Ignorantia juris neminem excusat.</span></i> The rule
is also expressed in the form of a legal presumption that every
one knows the law. The rule is absolute, and the presumption
irrebuttable. No diligence of inquiry will avail against
it; no inevitable ignorance or error will serve for justification.
Whenever a man is thus held accountable for breaking
a law which he did not know, and which he could not by due
care have acquired a knowledge of, the case is one of absolute
liability.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reasons rendered for this somewhat rigorous principle
are three in number. In the first place the law is in legal
theory definite and knowable; it is the duty of every man to
know that part of it which concerns him; therefore innocent
and inevitable ignorance of the law is impossible. Men are
conclusively presumed to know the law, and are dealt with as
if they did know it, because they can and ought to know it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the second place, even if invincible ignorance of the law
is in fact possible, the evidential difficulties in the way of the
judicial recognition of such ignorance are insuperable, and for
the sake of any benefit derivable therefrom it is not advisable
to weaken the administration of justice by making liability
dependent on well-nigh inscrutable conditions touching
knowledge or means of knowledge of the law. Who can say
of any man whether he knew the law, or whether during
the course of his past life he had an opportunity of acquiring
a knowledge of it by the exercise of due diligence?</p>

<p class='c007'>Thirdly and lastly, the law is in most instances derived
from and in harmony with the rules of natural justice. It is
a public declaration by the state of its intention to maintain
by force those principles of right and wrong which have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>already a secure place in the moral consciousness of men.
The common law is in great part nothing more than common
honesty and common sense. Therefore although a man may
be ignorant that he is breaking the law, he knows very well
in most cases that he is breaking the rule of right. If not
to his knowledge lawless, he is at least dishonest and unjust.
He has little ground of complaint, therefore, if the law refuses
to recognise his ignorance as an excuse, and deals with him
according to his moral deserts. He who goes about to harm
others when he believes that he can do so within the limits
of the law, may justly be required by the law to know those
limits at his peril. This is not a form of activity that need
be encouraged by any scrupulous insistence on the formal
conditions of legal responsibility.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be admitted, however, that while each of these
considerations is valid and weighty, they do not constitute an
altogether sufficient basis for so stringent and severe a rule.<a id='r382'></a><a href='#f382' class='c016'><sup>[382]</sup></a>
None of them goes the full length of the rule. That the law
is knowable throughout by all whom it concerns is an ideal
rather than a fact in any system as indefinite and mutable as
our own. That it is impossible to distinguish invincible from
negligent ignorance of the law is by no means wholly true.
It may be doubted whether this inquiry is materially more
difficult than many which courts of justice undertake without
hesitation. That he who breaks the law of the land disregards
at the same time the principles of justice and honesty is
in many instances far from the truth. In a complex legal
system a man requires other guidance than that of common
sense and a good conscience. The fact seems to be that the
rule in question, while in general sound, does not in its full
extent and uncompromising rigidity admit of any sufficient
justification.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 147. <b>Mistake of Fact.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>In respect of the influence of ignorance or error upon
legal liability we have inherited from Roman law a familiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>distinction between law and fact. By reason of his ignorance
of the law no man will be excused, but it is commonly said
that inevitable ignorance of fact is a good defence.<a id='r383'></a><a href='#f383' class='c016'><sup>[383]</sup></a> This, however,
is far from an accurate statement of English law. It is
much more nearly correct to say that mistake of fact is an
excuse only within the sphere of the criminal law, while in the
civil law responsibility is commonly absolute in this respect.
So far as civil liability is concerned, it is a general principle
of our law that he who intentionally interferes with the person,
property, reputation, or other rightful interests of
another does so at his peril, and will not be heard to allege
that he believed in good faith and on reasonable grounds in
the existence of some circumstance which justified his act.
If I trespass upon another man’s land, it is no defence to me
that I believed it on good grounds to be my own. If in absolute
innocence and under an inevitable mistake of fact I
meddle with another’s goods, I am liable for all loss incurred
by the true owner.<a id='r384'></a><a href='#f384' class='c016'><sup>[384]</sup></a> If, intending to arrest A., I arrest B. by
mistake instead, I am absolutely liable to him notwithstanding
the greatest care taken by me to ascertain his identity.
If I falsely but innocently make a defamatory statement
about another, I am liable to him however careful I may have
been to ascertain the truth. There are, indeed, exceptions
to this rule of absolute civil liability for mistake of fact, but
they are not of such number or importance as to cast any
doubt on the validity of the general principle.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the criminal law, on the other hand, the matter is otherwise,
and it is here that the contrast between mistake of law
and mistake of fact finds its true application. Absolute
criminal responsibility for a mistake of fact is quite exceptional.
An instance of it is the liability of him who abducts
a girl under the legal age of consent. Inevitable mistake as
to her age is no defence; he must take the risk.<a id='r385'></a><a href='#f385' class='c016'><sup>[385]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>A word may be said as to the historical origin of this failure of English
law to recognise inevitable mistake as a ground of exemption from civil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>liability. Ancient modes of procedure and proof were not adapted for
inquiries into mental conditions. By the practical difficulties of proof
early law was driven to attach exclusive importance to overt acts. The
subjective elements of wrongdoing were largely beyond proof or knowledge,
and were therefore disregarded as far as possible. It was a rule of our law
that intent and knowledge were not matters that could be proved or put
in issue. “It is common learning,” said one of the judges of King Edward
IV., “that the intent of a man will not be tried, for the devil himself
knoweth not the intent of a man.”<a id='r386'></a><a href='#f386' class='c016'><sup>[386]</sup></a> The sole question which the courts
would entertain was whether the defendant did the act complained of.
Whether he did it ignorantly or with guilty knowledge was entirely immaterial.
This rule, however, was restricted to civil liability. It was
early recognised that criminal responsibility was too serious a thing to
be imposed upon an innocent man simply for the sake of avoiding a difficult
inquiry into his knowledge and intention. In the case of civil liability,
on the other hand, the rule was general. The success with which it has
maintained itself in modern law is due in part to its undeniable utility in
obviating inconvenient or even impracticable inquiries, and in part to the
influence of the conception of redress in minimising the importance of the
formal condition of penal liability.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 148. <b>Accident.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Unlike mistake, inevitable accident is commonly recognised
by our law as a ground of exemption from liability. It
is needful, therefore, to distinguish accurately between these
two things, for they are near of kin. Every act which is not
done intentionally is done either accidentally or by mistake.
It is done accidentally, when it is unintentional in respect of
its <em>consequences</em>. It is done by mistake, when it is intentional
in respect of its consequences, but unintentional in respect of
some material <em>circumstance</em>. If I drive over a man in the
dark because I do not know that he is in the road, I injure
him accidentally; but if I procure his arrest, because I mistake
him for some one who is liable to arrest, I injure him not
accidentally but by mistake. In the former case I did not
intend the harm at all, while in the latter case I fully intended
it, but falsely believed in the existence of a circumstance
which would have served to justify it. So if by insufficient
care I allow my cattle to escape into my neighbour’s field,
their presence there is due to accident; but if I put them
there because I wrongly believe that the field is mine, their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>presence is due to mistake. In neither case did I intend to
wrong my neighbour, but in the one case my intention failed
as to the consequence, and in the other as to the circumstance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Accident, like mistake, is either culpable or inevitable. It
is culpable when due to negligence, but inevitable when the
avoidance of it would have required a degree of care exceeding
the standard demanded by the law. Culpable accident is
no defence, save in those exceptional cases in which wrongful
intent is the exclusive and necessary ground of liability.
Inevitable accident is commonly a good defence, both in the
civil and in the criminal law.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this rule, however, there are, at least in the civil law,
important exceptions. These are cases in which the law
insists that a man shall act at his peril, and shall take his
chance of accidents happening. If he desires to keep wild
beasts,<a id='r387'></a><a href='#f387' class='c016'><sup>[387]</sup></a> or to light fires,<a id='r388'></a><a href='#f388' class='c016'><sup>[388]</sup></a> or to construct a reservoir of water,<a id='r389'></a><a href='#f389' class='c016'><sup>[389]</sup></a>
or to accumulate upon his land any substance which will do
damage to his neighbours if it escapes,<a id='r390'></a><a href='#f390' class='c016'><sup>[390]</sup></a> or to erect dangerous
structures by which passengers in the highway may come to
harm,<a href='#f390' class='c016'><sup>[390]</sup></a> he will do all these things <i><span lang="la">suo periculo</span></i> (though none
of them are <i><span lang="la">per se</span></i> wrongful) and will answer for all ensuing
damage notwithstanding consummate care.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is one case of absolute liability for accident which
deserves special notice by reason of its historical origin. Every
man is absolutely responsible for the trespasses of his cattle.
If my horse or my ox escapes from my land to that of another
man, I am answerable for it without any proof of negligence.<a id='r391'></a><a href='#f391' class='c016'><sup>[391]</sup></a>
Such a rule may probably be justified as based on a reasonable
presumption of law that all such trespasses are the outcome
of negligent keeping. Viewed historically, however, the rule
is worth notice as one of the last relics of the ancient principle
that a man is answerable for all damage done by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>property. In the theory of ancient law I am liable for the
trespasses of my cattle, not because of my negligent keeping
of them, but because of my ownership of them. For the same
reason in Roman law a master was liable for the offences of
his slaves. The case is really, in its historical origin, one of
vicarious liability. In early law and custom vengeance, and
its products responsibility and punishment, were not conceived
as necessarily limited to human beings, but were in
certain cases extended to dumb animals and even inanimate
objects. We have already cited in another connection the
provision of the Mosaic law that “If an ox gore a man or a
woman that they die, then the ox shall be surely stoned and
his flesh shall not be eaten.”<a id='r392'></a><a href='#f392' class='c016'><sup>[392]</sup></a> In the <em>Laws</em> of Plato it is
said:<a id='r393'></a><a href='#f393' class='c016'><sup>[393]</sup></a> “If a beast of burden or other animal cause the death
of any one&#160;... the kinsman of the deceased shall prosecute
the slayer for murder, and the wardens of the country&#160;...
shall try the cause; and let the beast when condemned be
slain by them, and cast beyond the borders.” So in the Laws
of King Alfred:<a id='r394'></a><a href='#f394' class='c016'><sup>[394]</sup></a> “If at their common work,” (of wood
cutting) “one man slay another unwilfully, let the tree be
given to the kindred.” And by English law until the year
1846 the weapon or other thing which “moved to the death
of a man” was forfeited to the King as guilty and accursed.<a id='r395'></a><a href='#f395' class='c016'><sup>[395]</sup></a>
Here we have the ground of a rule of absolute liability.
If a man’s cattle or his slaves do damage, they are thereby
exposed to the vengeance of the injured person. But to
take destructive vengeance upon <em>them</em> is to impose a penalty
upon their <em>owner</em>. The liability thence resulting probably
passed through three stages: first, that of unconditional forfeiture
or surrender of the property to the vengeance of the
injured person; secondly, that of an option given to the
owner between forfeiture and redemption—the <i><span lang="la">actiones
noxales</span></i> of Roman law;<a id='r396'></a><a href='#f396' class='c016'><sup>[396]</sup></a> and thirdly, that of compulsory
redemption, or in other words, unconditional compensation.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ 149. <b>Vicarious Responsibility.</b></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Hitherto we have dealt exclusively with the conditions of
liability, and it is needful now to consider its incidence.
Normally and naturally the person who is liable for a wrong
is he who does it. Yet both ancient and modern law admit
instances of vicarious liability in which one man is made
answerable for the acts of another. Criminal responsibility,
indeed, is never vicarious at the present day, except in very
special circumstances and in certain of its less serious forms.<a id='r397'></a><a href='#f397' class='c016'><sup>[397]</sup></a>
In more primitive systems, however, the impulse to extend
vicariously the incidence of liability receives free scope in a
manner altogether alien to modern notions of justice. It is
in barbarous times considered a very natural thing to make
every man answerable for those who are of kin to him. In
the Mosaic legislation it is deemed necessary to lay down the
express rule that “The fathers shall not be put to death for
the children; neither shall the children be put to death for
the fathers; every man shall be put to death for his own
sin.”<a id='r398'></a><a href='#f398' class='c016'><sup>[398]</sup></a> Plato in his <em>Laws</em> does not deem it needless to
emphasise the same principle.<a id='r399'></a><a href='#f399' class='c016'><sup>[399]</sup></a> Furthermore, so long as
punishment is conceived rather as expiative, retributive, and
vindictive, than as deterrent and reformative, there seems
no reason why the incidence of liability should not be determined
by <em>consent</em>, and therefore why a guilty man should not
provide a substitute to bear his penalty and to provide the
needful satisfaction to the law. Guilt must be wiped out by
punishment, but there is no reason why the victim should
be one person rather than another. Such modes of thought
have long since ceased to pervert the law; but that they
were at one time natural is rendered sufficiently evident by
their survival in popular theology.</p>

<p class='c007'>Modern civil law recognises vicarious liability in two chief
classes of cases. In the first place, masters are responsible
for the acts of their servants done in the course of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>employment. In the second place, representatives of dead
men are liable for deeds done in the flesh by those whom they
represent. We shall briefly consider each of these two forms.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been sometimes said that the responsibility of a
master for his servant has its historical source in the responsibility
of an owner for his slave. This, however, is certainly
not the case. The English doctrine of employer’s liability
is of comparatively recent growth. It has its origin in the
legal presumption, gradually become conclusive, that all acts
done by a servant in and about his master’s business are done
by his master’s express or implied authority, and are therefore
in truth the acts of the master for which he may be justly
held responsible.<a id='r400'></a><a href='#f400' class='c016'><sup>[400]</sup></a> No employer will be allowed to say that
he did not authorise the act complained of, or even that it
was done against his express injunctions, for he is liable none
the less. This conclusive presumption of authority has now,
after the manner of such presumptions, disappeared from the
law, after having permanently modified it by establishing
the principle of employer’s liability. Historically, as we have
said, this is a fictitious extension of the principle, <i><span lang="la">Qui facit
per alium facit per se</span></i>. Formally, it has been reduced to the
laconic maxim, <i><span lang="la">Respondeat superior</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rational basis of this form of vicarious liability is in
the first place evidential. There are such immense difficulties
in the way of proving actual authority, that it is
necessary to establish a conclusive presumption of it. A
word, a gesture, or a tone may be a sufficient indication from
a master to his servant that some lapse from the legal standard
of care or honesty will be deemed acceptable service. Yet
who could prove such a measure of complicity? Who could
establish liability in such a case, were evidence of authority
required, or evidence of the want of it admitted?</p>

<p class='c007'>A further reason for the vicarious responsibility of employers
is that employers usually are, while their servants
usually are not, financially capable of the burden of civil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>liability. It is felt, probably with justice, that a man who is
able to make compensation for the hurtful results of his
activities should not be enabled to escape from the duty of
doing so by delegating the exercise of these activities to
servants or agents from whom no redress can be obtained.
Such delegation confers upon impecunious persons means and
opportunities of mischief which would otherwise be confined
to those who are financially competent. It disturbs the
correspondence which would otherwise exist between the
capacity of doing harm and the capacity of paying for it. It
is requisite for the efficacy of civil justice that this delegation
of powers and functions should be permitted only on the
condition that he who delegates them shall remain answerable
for the acts of his servants, as he would be for his own.</p>

<p class='c006'>A second form of vicarious responsibility is that of living
representatives for the acts of dead men. There is no doubt
that criminal responsibility must die with the wrongdoer
himself, but with respect to penal redress the question is not
free from difficulty. For in this form of liability there is a
conflict between the requirements of the two competing
principles of punishment and compensation. The former
demands the termination of liability with the life of the
wrongdoer, while the latter demands its survival. In this
dispute the older common law approved the first of those
alternatives. The received maxim was: <i><span lang="la">Actio personalis
moritur cum persona</span></i>. A man cannot be punished in his
grave; therefore it was held that all actions for penal redress,
being in their true nature instruments of punishment, must
be brought against the living offender and must die with him.
Modern opinion rejects this conclusion, and by various
statutory provisions the old rule has been in great part
abrogated. It is considered that although liability to afford
redress ought to depend in point of <em>origin</em> upon the requirements
of punishment, it should depend in point of <em>continuance</em>
upon those of compensation. For when this form
of liability has once come into existence, it is a valuable right
of the person wronged; and it is expedient that such rights
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>should be held upon a secure tenure, and should not be subject
to extinction by a mere irrelevant accident such as the
death of the offender. There is no sufficient reason for drawing
any distinction in point of survival between the right of a
creditor to recover his debt and the right of a man who has
been injured by assault or defamation to recover compensation
for the loss so suffered by him.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a further argument in the same sense, it is to be observed
that it is not strictly true that a man cannot be
punished after his death. Punishment is effective not at the
time it is inflicted, but at the time it is threatened. A threat
of evil to be inflicted upon a man’s descendants at the expense
of his estate will undoubtedly exercise a certain deterrent
influence upon him; and the apparent injustice of so
punishing his descendants for the offences of their predecessor
is in most cases no more than apparent. The right of
succession is merely the right to acquire the dead man’s
estate, subject to all charges which, on any grounds, and apart
altogether from the interests of the successors themselves,
may justly be imposed upon it.</p>

<p class='c019'>There is a second application of the maxim, <i><span lang="la">Actio personalis moritur cum
persona</span></i>, which seems equally destitute of justification. According to the
common law an action for penal redress died not merely with the wrongdoer
but also with the person wronged. This rule has been abrogated by
statute in part only. There can, however, be little doubt that in all
ordinary cases, if it is right to punish a person at all, his liability should not
cease simply by reason of the death of him against whom his offence was
committed. The right of the person injured to receive redress should
descend to his representatives like any other proprietary interest.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 150. <b>The Measure of Criminal Liability.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We have now considered the conditions and the incidence
of penal liability. It remains to deal with the measure of it,
and here we must distinguish between criminal and civil
wrongs, for the principles involved are fundamentally different
in the two cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>In considering the measure of criminal liability it will be
convenient to bestow exclusive attention upon the deterrent
purpose of the criminal law, remembering, however, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>conclusions so obtained are subject to possible modification
by reference to those subordinate and incidental purposes of
punishment which we thus provisionally disregard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Were men perfectly rational, so as to act invariably in
accordance with an enlightened estimate of consequences, the
question of the measure of punishment would present no
difficulty. A draconian simplicity and severity would be
perfectly just and perfectly effective. It would be possible
to act on the Stoic paradox that all offences involve equal
guilt, and to visit with the utmost rigour of the law every
deviation, however slight, from the appointed way. In other
words, if the deterrent effect of severity were certain and
complete, the best law would be that which by the most
extreme and undiscriminating severity effectually extinguished
crime. Were human nature so constituted that a
threat of burning all offenders alive would with certainty
prevent all breaches of the law, then this would be the just
and fitting penalty for all offences from high treason to petty
larceny. So greatly, however, are men moved by the impulse
of the moment, rather than by a rational estimate of future
good and evil, and so ready are they to face any future evil
which falls short of the inevitable, that the utmost rigour is
sufficient only for the diminution of crime, not for the extinction
of it. It is needful, therefore, in judging the merits of
the law, to subtract from the sum of good which results from
the partial prevention of offences, the sum of evil which
results from the partial failure of prevention and the consequent
necessity of fulfilling those threats of evil by which
the law had hoped to effect its purpose. The perfect law is
that in which the difference between the good and the evil
is at a maximum in favour of the good, and the rules as to
the measure of criminal liability are the rules for the attainment
of this maximum. It is obvious that it is not attainable
by an indefinite increase of severity. To substitute
hanging for imprisonment as the punishment for petty theft
would doubtless diminish the frequency of this offence, but it
is certain that the evil so prevented would be far outweighed
by that which the law would be called on to inflict in the
cases in which its threats proved unavailing.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>In every crime there are three elements to be taken into
account in determining the appropriate measure of punishment.
These are (1) the motives to the commission of the
offence, (2) the magnitude of the offence, and (3) the character
of the offender.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>The motive of the offence.</em> Other things being equal, the
greater the temptation to commit a crime the greater should
be the punishment. This is an obvious deduction from the
first principles of criminal liability. The object of punishment
is to counteract by the establishment of contrary and
artificial motives the natural motives which lead to crime.
The stronger these natural motives the stronger must be the
counteractives which the law supplies. If the profit to be
derived from an act is great, or the passions which lead men
to it are violent, a corresponding strength or violence is an
essential condition of the efficacy of repressive discipline. We
shall see later, however, that this principle is subject to a very
important limitation, and that there are many cases in which
extreme temptation is a ground of extenuation rather than of
increased severity of punishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>The magnitude of the offence.</em> Other things being equal,
the greater the offence, that is to say the greater the sum of its
evil consequences or tendencies, the greater should be its
punishment. At first sight, indeed, it would seem that this
consideration is irrelevant. Punishment, it may be thought,
should be measured solely by the profit derived by the
offender, not by the evils caused to other persons; if two
crimes are equal in point of motive, they should be equal in
point of punishment, notwithstanding the fact that one of
them maybe many times more mischievous than the other.
This, however, is not so, and the reason is twofold.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>a</em>) The greater the mischief of any offence the greater is
the punishment which it is profitable to inflict with the hope
of preventing it. For the greater this mischief the less is
the proportion which the evil of punishment bears to the
good of prevention, and therefore the greater is the punishment
which can be inflicted before the balance of good over
evil attains its maximum. Assuming the motives of larceny
and of homicide to be equal, it may be profitable to inflict
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>capital punishment for the latter offence, although it is certainly
unprofitable to inflict it for the former. The increased
measure of prevention that would be obtained by such
severity would, in view of the comparatively trivial nature of
the offence, be obtained at too great a cost.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>b</em>) A second and subordinate reason for making punishment
vary with the magnitude of the offence is that, in those
cases in which different offences offer themselves as alternatives
to the offender, an inducement is thereby given for
the preference of the least serious. If the punishment of
burglary is the same as that of murder, the burglar has
obvious motives for not stopping at the lesser crime. If an
attempt is punished as severely as a completed offence, why
should any man repent of his half-executed purposes?</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>The character of the offender.</em> The worse the character
or disposition of the offender the more severe should be his
punishment. Badness of disposition is constituted either by
the strength of the impulses to crime, or by the weakness of
the impulses towards law-abiding conduct. One man may be
worse than another because of the greater strength and prevalence
within him of such anti-social passions as anger, covetousness,
or malice; or his badness may lie in a deficiency of
those social impulses and instincts which are the springs of
right conduct in normally constituted men. In respect of
all the graver forms of law-breaking, for one man who
abstains from them for fear of the law there are thousands
who abstain by reason of quite other influences. Their
sympathetic instincts, their natural affections, their religious
beliefs, their love of the approbation of others, their pride
and self-respect, render superfluous the threatenings of
the law. In the degree in which these impulses are dominant
and operative, the disposition of a man is good;
in the degree in which they are wanting or inefficient, it
is bad.</p>

<p class='c007'>In both its kinds badness of disposition is a ground for
severity of punishment. If a man’s emotional constitution
is such that normal temptation acts upon him with abnormal
force, it is for the law to supply in double measure the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>counteractive of penal discipline. If he is so made that
the natural influences towards well-doing fall below the
level of average humanity, the law must supplement them by
artificial influences of a strength that is needless in ordinary
cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any fact, therefore, which indicates depravity of disposition
is a circumstance of aggravation, and calls for a penalty
in excess of that which would otherwise be appropriate to the
offence. One of the most important of these facts is the
repetition of crime by one who has been already punished.
The law rightly imposes upon habitual offenders penalties
which bear no relation either to the magnitude or to the profit
of the offence. A punishment adapted for normal men is not
appropriate for those who, by their repeated defiance of it,
prove their possession of abnormal natures. A second case
in which the same principle is applicable is that in which the
mischief of an offence is altogether disproportionate to any
profit to be derived from it by the offender. To kill a man
from mere wantonness, or merely in order to facilitate the
picking of his pocket, is a proof of extraordinary depravity
beyond anything that is imputable to him who commits
homicide only through the stress of passionate indignation or
under the influence of great temptation. A third case is that
of offences from which normal humanity is adequately dissuaded
by such influences as those of natural affection. To
kill one’s father is in point of magnitude no worse a crime
than any other homicide, but it has at all times been viewed
with greater abhorrence, and by some laws punished with
greater severity, by reason of the depth of depravity which it
indicates in the offender. Lastly it is on the same principle
that wilful offences are punished with greater rigour than
those which are due merely to negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>An additional and subordinate reason for making the
measure of liability depend upon the character of the offender
is that badness of disposition is commonly accompanied by
deficiency of sensibility. Punishment must increase as sensibility
diminishes. The more depraved the offender the less
he feels the shame of punishment; therefore the more he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>must be made to feel the pain of it. A certain degree of
even physical insensibility is said to characterise the more
degraded orders of criminals; and the indifference with which
death itself is faced by those who in the callousness of their
hearts have not scrupled to inflict it upon others is a matter
of amazement to normally constituted men.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are now in a position to deal with a question which we
have already touched upon but deferred for fuller consideration,
namely the apparent paradox involved in the rule that
punishment must increase with the temptation to the offence.
As a general rule this proposition is true; but it is subject to
a very important qualification. For in certain cases the
temptation to which a man succumbs may be of such a nature
as to rebut that presumption of a bad disposition which would
in ordinary circumstances arise from the commission of the
offence. He may, for example, be driven to the act not by
the strength of any bad or self-regarding motives, but by that
of his social or sympathetic impulses. In such a case the
greatness of the temptation, considered in itself, demands
severity of punishment, but when considered as a disproof of
the degraded disposition which usually accompanies wrongdoing
it demands leniency; and the latter of these two conflicting
considerations may be of sufficient importance to
outweigh the other. If a man remains honest until he is
driven in despair to steal food for his starving children, it is
perfectly consistent with the deterrent theory of punishment
to deal with him less severely than with him who steals
from no other motive than cupidity. He who commits homicide
from motives of petty gain, or to attain some trivial purpose,
deserves to be treated with the utmost severity, as a
man thoroughly callous and depraved. But he who kills
another in retaliation for some intolerable insult or injury
need not be dealt with according to the measure of his temptations,
but should rather be excused on account of them.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 151. <b>The Measure of Civil Liability.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Penal redress is that form of penal liability in which the
law uses the compulsory compensation of the person injured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>as an instrument for the punishment of the offender. It is
characteristic of this form of punishment that it takes account
of one only of the three considerations which, as we have
seen, rightly determine the measure of penal responsibility.
It is measured exclusively by the magnitude of the offence,
that is to say, by the amount of loss inflicted by it. It takes
no account of the character of the offender, and so visits him
who does harm through some trivial want of care with as
severe a penalty as if his act had been prompted by deliberate
malice. Similarly it takes no account of the motives of the
offence; he who has everything and he who has nothing to
gain are equally punished, if the damage done by them is
equal. Finally it takes no account of probable or intended
consequences, but solely of those which actually ensue;
wherefore the measure of a wrongdoer’s liability is not the
evil which he meant to do, but that which he has succeeded
in doing; and his punishment is determined not by his fault,
but by the accident of the result. If one man is dealt with
more severely than another, it is not because he is more
guilty, but because he has had the misfortune to be more
successful in his wrongful purposes, or less successful in the
avoidance of unintended issues.</p>

<p class='c007'>Serious as are these lapses from the due standard of penal
discipline, it is not to be suggested that this form of civil
liability is unjustifiable. The use of redress as an instrument
of punishment possesses advantages more than sufficient
to counterbalance any such objections to it. More
especially it possesses this, that while other forms of punishment,
such as imprisonment, are uncompensated evil, penal
redress is the gain of him who is wronged as well as the loss of
the wrongdoer. Further, this form of remedy gives to the
persons injured a direct interest in the efficient administration
of justice—an interest which is almost absent in the case of
the criminal law. It is true, however, that the law of penal
redress, taken by itself, falls so far short of the requirements
of a rational scheme of punishment that it would by itself be
totally insufficient. In all modern and developed bodies of
law its operation is supplemented, and its deficiencies made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>good, by a co-ordinate system of criminal liability. These
two together, combined in due proportions, constitute a very
efficient instrument for the maintenance of justice.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XX.<br> <span class='c013'>THE LAW OF PROPERTY.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 152. <b>Meanings of the Term Property.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The substantive civil law<a id='r401'></a><a href='#f401' class='c016'><sup>[401]</sup></a> is divisible into three great departments,
namely the law of property, the law of obligations,
and the law of status. The first deals with proprietary
rights <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i>, the second with proprietary rights <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>,
and the third with personal or non-proprietary rights, whether
<i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i> or <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>. In this chapter we shall consider in
outline the first of these branches, and we shall then proceed
to deal in the same manner with the law of obligations. The
law of status on the other hand is not of such a nature as to
require or repay any further consideration from the point of
view of general theory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The term property, which we here use as meaning proprietary
rights <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i>, possesses a singular variety of different
applications having different degrees of generality. These
are the following:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>All legal rights.</em> In its widest sense, property includes
all a person’s legal rights, of whatever description. A man’s
property is all that is <em>his in law</em>. This usage, however, is
obsolete at the present day, though it is common enough in
the older books. Thus Blackstone speaks of the property
(<em>i.e.</em> right) which a master has in the person of his servant,
and a father in the person of his child. “The inferior,” he
says,<a id='r402'></a><a href='#f402' class='c016'><sup>[402]</sup></a> “hath no kind of property in the company, care, or
assistance of the superior, as the superior is held to have in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>those of the inferior.” So Hobbes says:<a id='r403'></a><a href='#f403' class='c016'><sup>[403]</sup></a> “Of things held in
propriety, those that are dearest to a man are his own life and
limbs; and in the next degree, in most men, those that concern
conjugal affection; and after them riches and means of
living.” In like manner Locke<a id='r404'></a><a href='#f404' class='c016'><sup>[404]</sup></a> tells us that “every man
has a property in his own person,” and he speaks elsewhere<a id='r405'></a><a href='#f405' class='c016'><sup>[405]</sup></a>
of a man’s right to preserve “his property, that is, his life,
liberty, and estate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i><span lang="la">Proprietary rights (dominium and status).</span></i> In a second
and narrower sense, property includes not all a person’s rights
but only his proprietary as opposed to his personal rights.
The former constitute his estate or property, while the latter
constitute his status or personal condition. In this sense a
man’s land, chattels, shares, and the debts due to him are his
property; but not his life or liberty or reputation. In this
sense we may oppose to Locke’s statement, that a man has a
property in his own person, the saying of Ulpian: <i><span lang="la">Dominus
membrorum suorum nemo videtur</span></i>.<a id='r406'></a><a href='#f406' class='c016'><sup>[406]</sup></a> This is probably the most
frequent application of the term at the present day, but in the
case of a word having so many recognised varieties of usage
it is idle to attempt to single out any one of them as exclusively
correct. They are all of equal authenticity.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i><span lang="la">Proprietary rights in rem (dominium and obligatio).</span></i> In
a third application, which is that adopted in this chapter, the
term includes not even all proprietary rights, but only those
which are both proprietary and real. The law of property is
the law of proprietary rights <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i>, the law of proprietary
rights <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i> being distinguished from it as the law of
obligations. According to this usage a freehold or leasehold
estate in land, or a patent or copyright, is property; but a
debt or the benefit of a contract is not.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>Corporeal property (<span lang="la">dominium corporis</span> and <span lang="la">dominium
juris</span>).</em> Finally, in the narrowest use of the term, it includes
nothing more than corporeal property—that is to say, the
right of ownership in a material object, or that object itself
identified with the right by way of metonymy. Thus property
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>is defined by Ahrens<a id='r407'></a><a href='#f407' class='c016'><sup>[407]</sup></a> as “a material object subject to the
immediate power of a person,” and Bentham<a id='r408'></a><a href='#f408' class='c016'><sup>[408]</sup></a> considers as
metaphorical and improper the extension of the term to include
other rights than those which relate to material things.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 153. <b>Kinds of Property.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>All property is, as we have already seen,<a id='r409'></a><a href='#f409' class='c016'><sup>[409]</sup></a> either corporeal
or incorporeal. Corporeal property is the right of ownership
in material things; incorporeal property is any other proprietary
right <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i>. Incorporeal property is itself of two
kinds, namely (1) <i><span lang="la">jura in re aliena</span></i> or encumbrances, whether
over material or immaterial things (for example, leases,
mortgages, and servitudes), and (2) <i><span lang="la">jura in re propria</span></i> over
immaterial things (for example, patents, copyrights, and
trade-marks). The resulting threefold division of property
appears in the following Table:—</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 154. <b>The Ownership of Material Things.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The owner of a material object is he who owns a right to
the aggregate of its uses. He who has merely a special and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>definitely limited right to the use of it, such as a right of
way or other servitude, is not an owner of the thing but merely
an encumbrancer of it. The definition, however, must not be
misunderstood. Ownership is the right of <em>general</em> use, not
that of absolute or unlimited use. He is the owner of a thing
who is entitled to all those uses of it which are not specially
excepted and cut off by the law. No such right as that of
absolute and unlimited use is known to the law. All lawful
use is either general (that is to say, residuary) or specific,
the former being ownership, and the latter encumbrance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The limits thus imposed upon an owner’s right of use are
of two kinds. The first constitute the <em>natural</em> limits of
ownership. They are the various applications of the maxim:
<i><span lang="la">Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas</span></i>—a legal principle whose
function it is to restrain within due bounds the opposing
maxim that a man may do as he pleases with his own. In
the interests of the public or of a man’s neighbours many
uses of the things which are his are wholly excluded from
his right of ownership.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second class of restrictions upon an owner’s right of
use consists of those which flow from the existence of encumbrances
vested in other persons. These are artificial limits
which may or may not exist. My land may be mortgaged,
leased, charged, bound by restrictive covenants, and so on,
yet I remain the owner of it none the less. For I am still
entitled to the residue of its uses, and whatever right over it
is not specifically vested in some one else is vested in me.
The residuary use so left to me may be of very small dimensions;
some encumbrancer may own rights over it much
more valuable than mine; but the ownership of it is in me and
not in him. Were his right to determine to-morrow in any
manner, my own, relieved from the encumbrance which now
weighs it down, would forthwith spring up to its full stature
and have again its full effect. No right loses its identity
because of an encumbrance vested in some one else. That
which is a right of ownership when there are no encumbrances,
remains a right of ownership notwithstanding any
number of them.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>Inasmuch as the right of ownership is a right to the aggregate
of the uses of the thing, it follows that ownership is
necessarily permanent. No person having merely a temporary
right to the use of a thing can be the owner of the
thing, however general that right may be while it lasts. He
who comes after him is the owner; for it is to him that the
residue of the uses of the thing pertains. It is to be understood,
however, that by a permanent right is meant nothing
more than a right which is capable of lasting as long as the
thing itself which is its subject-matter, however long or short
that duration may be.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even as the generality of ownership involves its permanence,
so its permanence involves the further essential feature
of inheritance. The only permanent rights which can be
owned by a mortal man are those which can be handed down
by him to his successors or representatives on his death. All
others are temporary, their duration being necessarily limited
to the lifetime of him in whom they are vested. The right
of ownership, therefore, is essentially an inheritable right.
It is capable of surviving its owner for the time being. It
belongs to the class of rights which are divested by death
but are not extinguished by it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Summing up the conclusions to which we have attained,
we may define the right of ownership in a material thing as
the general, permanent, and inheritable right to the uses of
that thing.<a id='r410'></a><a href='#f410' class='c016'><sup>[410]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>According to the rigour of English legal doctrine there can be no owner
of <em>land</em> except the Crown itself. The fee simple of land—the greatest right
in it which a subject can possess—is not in truth ownership, but a mere
encumbrance upon the ownership of the Crown. It is a tenancy or lease
granted to a man and his heirs. It is a temporary not a permanent right of
user. It will come to its natural termination on the death of the tenant
without leaving an heir or devisee in whom the right may be continued.
The land will thereupon revert or escheat to the Crown; that is to say, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>Crown’s ownership, which has never been divested, but has merely been
encumbered by the fee simple, will through the destruction of this encumbrance
become once more free and absolute. In the case of chattels it is
otherwise. They can be owned by the subject no less than by the Crown.
It is true that if the owner of them dies intestate without kin, they will
go to the Crown as <i><span lang="la">bona vacantia</span></i>, just as land will go to the Crown as an
escheat. But between these two processes there is a profound difference
in legal theory. In the case of chattels the Crown succeeds to the right
which was vested in the dead man; his ownership is continued in the
Crown, just as it would have been continued in his next of kin had there
been any. But in the case of escheat, as already said, the right of the
dead man has come to an end, and the Crown succeeds to no right of his,
but simply comes into its own again.</p>

<p class='c019'>This distinction, however, between the fee simple of land and the
ownership of it is a matter of form rather than of substance. In fact,
if not in legal theory, the right of a tenant in fee simple is permanent;
for escheat takes place only on an intestacy, and therefore can be prevented
by the act of the tenant. We are at liberty, therefore, to disregard
this technicality of real property law, and to speak of the fee simple of land
as the ownership of it, the right of the Crown being viewed, accordingly,
not as vested and continuing ownership subject to an encumbrance, but as
a contingent right of succession to an intestate owner.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 155. <b>Movable and Immovable Property.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Among material things the most important distinction is
that between movables and immovables, or, to use terms
more familiar in English law, between chattels and land. In
all legal systems these two classes of objects are to some
extent governed by different rules, though in no system is
the difference so great as in our own.</p>

<p class='c007'>Considered in its legal aspect, an immovable, that is to
say, a piece of land, includes the following elements:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. A determinate portion of the earth’s surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The ground beneath the surface down to the centre of
the world. All the pieces of land in England meet together
in one terminal point at the earth’s centre.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Possibly the column of space above the surface <i><span lang="la">ad
infinitum</span></i>. “The earth,” says Coke,<a id='r411'></a><a href='#f411' class='c016'><sup>[411]</sup></a> “hath in law a great
extent upwards, not only of water as hath been said, but of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>ayre and all other things even up to heaven; for <i><span lang="la">Cujus est
solum, ejus est usque ad coelum</span></i>.” The authenticity of this
doctrine, however, is not wholly beyond dispute. It would
prohibit as an actionable trespass all use of the air-space
above the appropriated surface of the earth, at whatever
height this use took place, and however little it could affect
the interests of the landowner. If a man is carried in a
balloon at a distance of half a mile above the ground, does he
infringe the rights of those who own the surface? It may be
that the law recognises no right of ownership in the air-space
at all, or at least no right of exclusive use, but merely prohibits
all acts which by their nature or their proximity interfere
with the full enjoyment and use of the surface.<a id='r412'></a><a href='#f412' class='c016'><sup>[412]</sup></a> By the
German Civil Code,<a id='r413'></a><a href='#f413' class='c016'><sup>[413]</sup></a> the owner of land owns the space above
it, but has no right to prohibit acts so remote from the surface
that they in no way affect his interests.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. All objects which are on or under the surface in its
natural state; for example, minerals and natural vegetation.
All these are part of the land, even though they are in no way
physically attached to it. Stones lying loose upon the surface
are in the same category as the stone in a quarry.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Lastly all objects placed by human agency on or under
the surface, with the intention of permanent annexation.
These become part of the land, and lose their identity as
separate movables or chattels; for example, buildings, walls,
and fences. <i><span lang="la">Omne quod inaedificatur solo cedit</span></i>, said the
Roman law.<a id='r414'></a><a href='#f414' class='c016'><sup>[414]</sup></a> Provided that the requisite intent of permanent
annexation is present, no physical attachment to the
surface is required. A wall built of stones without mortar
or foundations is part of the land on which it stands.<a id='r415'></a><a href='#f415' class='c016'><sup>[415]</sup></a>
Conversely physical attachment, without the intent of
permanent annexation, is not in itself enough. Carpets,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>tapestries, or ornaments nailed to the floors or walls of a
house are not thereby made part of the house. Money
buried in the ground is as much a chattel<a id='r416'></a><a href='#f416' class='c016'><sup>[416]</sup></a> as money in its
owner’s pocket.<a id='r417'></a><a href='#f417' class='c016'><sup>[417]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>It is clear that the distinction between movables and immovables is in
truth and in fact applicable to material objects only. Yet, the law has
made an unfortunate attempt to apply it to <em>rights</em> also. Rights no less
than things are conceived by the law as having a local situation, and as
being either movable or permanently fixed in a definite locality. The
origin of this illogical conception is to be found in the identification of rights
of ownership with the material things which are the objects of them. I
am said to own land and chattels, as well as easements, shares, debts,
contracts, and patents. All these things are equally property, and since
some of them have a local situation and can be truly classed as movable or
immovable, the law has been led by inadvertence to attribute these
qualities to all of them. It has recognised in things which are incorporeal
certain attributes which in truth pertain to things corporeal only. It
has divided the whole sphere of proprietary rights by reference to a distinction
which is truly applicable not to rights at, all, but to physical objects.
Nor is this merely a peculiarity of English law, for it is found in Continental
systems also.<a id='r418'></a><a href='#f418' class='c016'><sup>[418]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>On what principle, then, does the law determine whether a right is to
be classed as immovable or as movable? The general rule is that a right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>has in this respect the same quality as its subject-matter. Every right
over an immovable thing, whether it is a right of ownership, or a lease, or
a servitude, or a security, or any other <i><span lang="la">jus in re aliena</span></i>, is itself immovable,
and every right over a movable thing is itself movable. So far there is
no difficulty. What shall we say, however, of those rights which have no
material objects at all, such as a copyright, a patent, the good-will of a
business, a trade-mark, or the benefit of a contract? The answer is that
all such rights are classed by the law as movable. For the class of movable
property is residuary, and includes all rights which can make good no claim
to be classed as immovable.</p>

<p class='c020'>The law not merely classifies rights as movable and immovable, but
goes further in the same direction, and attributes local situation to them.
It undertakes to say not merely <em>whether</em> a right exists, but <em>where</em> it exists.
Nor is this a difficult task in the case of those rights which have determinate
material things as their objects. A servitude or other <i><span lang="la">jus in re
aliena</span></i> over a piece of land is situated in law where the land is situated in
fact. A right over a chattel is movable property, and where the chattel
goes the right goes also. But where there is no material object at all,
what are we to say as to the local situation of the right? Where is a
debt situated, or a share, in a company, or the benefit of a contract, or a
copyright? Such questions can be determined only by more or less
arbitrary rules based upon analogy, and it is to be regretted that it has been
thought needful to ask and answer them at all. As the law stands, however,
it contains several rules based on the assumption that all property which
exists must exist <em>somewhere</em>,<a id='r419'></a><a href='#f419' class='c016'><sup>[419]</sup></a> and for the application of these rules the
determination of the local situation of rights is necessary, even though it
leads into the region of legal fictions. “The legal conception of property,”
says Lord Lindley,<a id='r420'></a><a href='#f420' class='c016'><sup>[420]</sup></a> “appears to me to involve the legal conception of
existence somewhere.... To talk of property as existing nowhere is to
use language which to me is unintelligible.”</p>

<p class='c020'>The leading principle as to the local situation of rights is that they are
situated where they are exercised and enjoyed. Rights over material
things, therefore, have the same situation as those things themselves.
The good-will of a business is situated in the place where the business is
carried on.<a id='r421'></a><a href='#f421' class='c016'><sup>[421]</sup></a> Debts are in general situated in the place where the debtor
resides,<a id='r422'></a><a href='#f422' class='c016'><sup>[422]</sup></a> since it is there that the creditor must go to get his money.<a id='r423'></a><a href='#f423' class='c016'><sup>[423]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ 156. <b>Real and Personal Property.</b></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Derived from and closely connected with the distinction
between immovable and movable property is that between
real and personal property. These are two cross divisions of
the whole sphere of proprietary rights. Real property and
immovable property form intersecting circles which are very
nearly though not quite coincident. The law of real property
is almost equivalent to the law of land, while the law of
personal property is all but identical with the law of movables.
The partial failure of coincidence is due not to any
logical distinction, but to the accidental course of legal
development; and to this extent the distinction between real
and personal property is purely arbitrary and possesses no
scientific basis. Real property comprises all rights over
land, with such additions and exceptions as the law has seen
fit to establish. All other proprietary rights, whether <i><span lang="la">in
rem</span></i> or <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>, pertain to the law of personal property.</p>

<p class='c019'>The distinction between real and personal property has no logical
connexion with that between real and personal rights. There is, however,
an historical relation between them, inasmuch as they are both derived
from the same source, namely the Roman distinction between actions
<i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i> and actions <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>. Real property meant originally that
which was recoverable in a real action, while personal property was that
which was recoverable in a personal action, and this English distinction
between real and personal actions was derived by Bracton and the other
founders of our law from the <i><span lang="la">actiones in rem</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i> of Justinian,
though not without important modifications of the Roman doctrine.<a id='r424'></a><a href='#f424' class='c016'><sup>[424]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>In connexion with the distinctions between movable and immovable,
and between real and personal property, we must notice the legal significance
of the term chattel. This word has apparently three different meanings
in English law:—</p>

<p class='c019'>1. A movable physical object; for example, a horse, a book, or a
shilling, as contrasted with a piece of land.</p>

<p class='c019'>2. Movable property, whether corporeal or incorporeal; that is to say,
chattels in the first sense together with all proprietary rights except those
which are classed as immovable. In this usage debts, shares, contracts,
and other choses in action are chattels, no less than furniture or stock in
trade. So also are patents, copyrights, and other rights <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i> which are
not rights over land. This double use of the word chattel to indicate both
material things and rights is simply an application, within the sphere of
movable property, of the metonymy which is the source of the distinction
between corporeal and incorporeal property.</p>

<p class='c019'>3. Personal property, whether movable or immovable, as opposed to
real property. In this sense leaseholds are classed as chattels, because of
the special rule by which they are excluded from the domain of real
property.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 157. <b>Rights <i><span lang="la">in re propria</span></i> in Immaterial Things.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The subject-matter of a right of property is either a
material or an immaterial thing. A material thing is a physical
object; an immaterial thing is anything else which may
be the subject-matter of a right.<a id='r425'></a><a href='#f425' class='c016'><sup>[425]</sup></a> It is to things of the former
class that the law of property almost wholly relates. In the
great majority of cases a right of property is a right to the uses
of a material object. It is the chief purpose of this department
of the law to allot to every man his portion in the material
instruments of human well-being—to divide the earth and the
fulness of it among the men who live in it. The only immaterial
things which are recognised by law as the subject-matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>of rights of this description are the various <em>immaterial
products of human skill and labour</em>. Speaking generally we
may say that in modern law every man owns that which he
creates. That which he produces is his, and he has an exclusive
right to the use and benefit of it. The immaterial
product of a man’s brains may be as valuable as his land
or his goods. The law, therefore, gives him a proprietary
right in it, and the unauthorised use of it by other persons
is a violation of his ownership, no less than theft or trespass
is. These immaterial forms of property are of five chief
kinds:—<a id='r426'></a><a href='#f426' class='c016'><sup>[426]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>Patents.</em> The subject-matter of a patent-right is an
invention. He whose skill or labour produces the idea of a
new process, instrument, or manufacture, has that idea as
his own in law. He alone is entitled to use it and to draw
from it the profit inherent in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>Literary copyright.</em> The subject-matter of this right
is the literary expression of facts or thoughts. He to whose
skill or labour this expression is due has in it a proprietary
right of exclusive use.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>Artistic copyright.</em> Artistic design in all its various
forms, such as drawing, painting, sculpture, and photography,
is the subject-matter of a right of exclusive use
analogous to literary copyright. The creations of an artist’s
skill or of a photographer’s labour are his exclusive property.
The object of this right is not the material thing produced,
but the <em>form</em> impressed upon it by the maker. The picture,
in the concrete sense of the material paint and canvas, belongs
to him who purchases it; but the picture, in the
abstract sense of the artistic form made visible by that paint
and canvas, belongs to him who made it. The former is
material property, the latter is immaterial. The right in each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>case is one of exclusive use. The right to the material picture
is infringed by destroying it or taking it away. The right
to the immaterial picture is infringed by making material
pictures which embody it.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>Musical and dramatic copyright.</em> A fourth class of
immaterial things consists of musical and dramatic works.
The immaterial product of the skill of the musician or the
playwright is the subject-matter of a proprietary right of
exclusive use which is infringed by any unauthorised performance
or representation.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. <em>Commercial good-will; trade-marks and trade-names.</em>
The fifth and last species of immaterial things includes commercial
good-will and the special forms of it known as trade-marks
and trade-names. He who by his skill and labour
establishes a business acquires thereby an interest in the
good-will of it, that is to say, in the established disposition
of customers to resort to him. To this good-will he has an
exclusive right which is violated by any one who seeks to
make use of it for his own advantage, as by falsely representing
to the public that he is himself carrying on the business
in question. Special forms of this right of commercial good-will
are rights to trade-names and trade-marks. Every man
has an exclusive right to the name under which he carries
on business or sells his goods—to this extent at least that
no one is at liberty to use that name for the purpose of
deceiving the public and so injuring the owner of it. He has
a similar right to the exclusive use of the marks which he
impresses upon his goods, and by which they are known and
identified in the market as his.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 158. <b>Leases.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Having now considered the different kinds of rights <i><span lang="la">in re
propria</span></i> which fall within the law of property, we proceed to
deal with the various rights <i><span lang="la">in re aliena</span></i> to which they may
be subject. As already stated,<a id='r427'></a><a href='#f427' class='c016'><sup>[427]</sup></a> the chief of these are four in
number, namely Leases, Servitudes, Securities, and Trusts.
The nature of a trust has been sufficiently examined in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>another connexion,<a id='r428'></a><a href='#f428' class='c016'><sup>[428]</sup></a> and it is necessary here to consider the
other three only.<a id='r429'></a><a href='#f429' class='c016'><sup>[429]</sup></a> And first of leases or tenancies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although a lease of land and a bailment of chattels are
transactions of essentially the same nature, there is no term
which, in its recognised use, is sufficiently wide to include
both. The term bailment is never applied to the tenancy of
land, and although the term lease is not wholly inapplicable
in the case of chattels, its use in this connexion is subject to
arbitrary limitations. It is necessary, therefore, in the
interests of orderly classification, to do some violence to
received usage, in adopting the term lease as a generic expression
to include not merely the tenancy of land, but all
kinds of bailments of chattels, and all encumbrances of incorporeal
property which possess the same essential nature
as a tenancy of land.</p>

<p class='c007'>A lease, in this generic sense, is that form of encumbrance
which consists in a right to the possession and use of property
owned by some other person. It is the outcome of the rightful
separation of ownership and possession. We have seen
that possession is the continuing exercise of a right, and that
although a right is normally exercised by the owner of it, it
may in special cases be exercised by some one else. This
separation of ownership and possession may be either rightful
or wrongful, and if rightful it is an encumbrance of the
owner’s title.<a id='r430'></a><a href='#f430' class='c016'><sup>[430]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The right which is thus encumbered by a lease is usually
the ownership of a material object, and more particularly the
ownership of land. Here as elsewhere the material object is
identified in speech with the right itself. We say that the
<em>land</em> is leased, just as we say that the land is owned or possessed.
The lessee of land is he who rightfully possesses it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>but does not own it. The lessor of land is he who owns it,
but who has transferred the possession of it to another. Encumbrance
by way of lease is not confined, however, to the
right of ownership of a material object. All rights may be
leased which can be possessed, that is to say, which admit
of continuing exercise; and no rights can be leased which
cannot be possessed, that is to say, which are extinguished by
their exercise. A servitude appurtenant to land, such as a
right of way, is leased along with the land itself. The owner
of a lease may encumber it with a sub-lease. The owner of
a patent or copyright may grant a lease of it for a term of
years, entitling the lessee to the exercise and use of the right
but not to the ownership of it. Even obligations may be
encumbered in the same fashion, provided that they admit
of continuing or repeated exercise; for example, annuities,
shares, money in the public funds, or interest-bearing debts.
All these may be rightfully possessed without being owned,
and owned without being possessed, as when they are settled
in trust for a tenant for life with remainder to some one else.</p>

<p class='c019'>Is it essential that a lease should be of less duration than the right
which is subject to it? This is almost invariably the case; land is leased
for a term of years or for life, but not in perpetuity; the owner of a thing
owns it for ever, but the lessee of it possesses it for a time. We may be
tempted, therefore, to regard this difference of duration as essential, and
to define a lease as a right to the temporary exercise of a right vested in
some one else. But this is not so. There is no objection in principle to
a lease of land in perpetuity, or to a lease of a patent or copyright for the
full term of its existence. It may be objected that a lease of this description
would not be a true lease or encumbrance at all, but an assignment
of the right itself; that the grantee would become the owner of the right,
and not a mere encumbrancer; and in favour of this contention it may
be pointed out that a sub-lease for the whole term is construed in English
law as an assignment of the term, a sub-lease being necessarily shorter
than the term, if only by a single day.<a id='r431'></a><a href='#f431' class='c016'><sup>[431]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>Whatever the actual rule of English law may be, however, there is
nothing in legal theory to justify us in asserting that any such difference
of duration is essential to the existence of a true lease. A lease exists
whenever the rightful possession of a thing is separated from the ownership
of it; and although this separation is usually temporary, there is
no difficulty in supposing it permanent. I may own a permanent right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>to exercise another right, without owning the latter right itself. The
ownership may remain dormant, deprived of any right of exercise and
enjoyment, in the hands of the lessor. I am not necessarily the owner of
a patent, because I have acquired by contract with the owner a right to
the exclusive use of it during the whole term of its duration. So far as
legal principle is concerned, I may still remain the owner of a lease,
although I may have granted a sub-lease to another for the whole residue
of the term. To assign a lease and to sublet it for the whole term are
in the intention of the parties and in legal theory two entirely different
transactions. The assignment is a substitution of one tenant for another,
the assignor retaining no rights whatever. The sub-lease, on the contrary,
is designed to leave the original relation of landlord and tenant
untouched, the sub-lessee being the tenant of the lessee and not of the
original lessor.<a id='r432'></a><a href='#f432' class='c016'><sup>[432]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 159. <b>Servitudes.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>A servitude is that form of encumbrance which consists in
a right to the limited use of a piece of land without the
possession of it; for example, a right of way over it, a right
to the passage of light across it to the windows of a house on
the adjoining land, a right to depasture cattle upon it, or a
right to derive support from it for the foundations of an
adjoining building.<a id='r433'></a><a href='#f433' class='c016'><sup>[433]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is an essential characteristic of a servitude that it does
not involve the possession of the land over which it exists.
This is the difference between a servitude and a lease. A
lease of land is the rightful possession and use without the
ownership of it, while a servitude over land is the rightful
use without either the ownership or the possession of it.
There are two distinct methods in which I may acquire a
road across another man’s property. I may agree with him
for the exclusive possession of a defined strip of the land; or I
may agree with him for the use of such a strip for the sole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>purpose of passage, without any exclusive possession or
occupation of it. In the first case I acquire a lease; in the
second a servitude.<a id='r434'></a><a href='#f434' class='c016'><sup>[434]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Servitudes are of two kinds, which may be distinguished as
private and public. A private servitude is one vested in a
determinate individual; for example, a right of way, of light,
or of support, vested in the owner of one piece of land over an
adjoining piece, or a right granted to one person of fishing in
the water of another, or of mining in another’s land. A public
servitude is one vested in the public at large or in some
class of indeterminate individuals; for example, the right of
the public to a highway over land in private ownership, the
right of the public to navigate a river of which the bed
belongs to some private person, the right of the inhabitants
of a parish to use a certain piece of private ground for the
purposes of recreation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Servitudes are further distinguishable in the language of
English law as being either appurtenant or in gross. A
servitude appurtenant is one which is not merely an encumbrance
of one piece of land, but is also accessory to another
piece. It is a right of using one piece for the benefit of
another; as in the case of a right of way from A.’s house to
the high road across B.’s field, or a right of support for a
building, or a right to the access of light to a window. The
land which is burdened with such a servitude is called the
servient land or tenement; that which has the benefit of it
is called the dominant land or tenement. The servitude
runs with each of the tenements into the hands of successive
owners and occupiers. Both the benefit and the
burden of it are concurrent with the ownership of the
lands concerned. A servitude is said to be in gross,
on the other hand, when it is not so attached and
accessory to any dominant tenement for whose benefit
it exists. An example is a public right of way or of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>navigation or of recreation, or a private right of fishing,
pasturage, or mining.<a id='r435'></a><a href='#f435' class='c016'><sup>[435]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 160. <b>Securities.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>A security is an encumbrance, the purpose of which is to
ensure or facilitate the fulfilment or enjoyment of some other
right (usually though not necessarily a debt) vested in the
same person.<a id='r436'></a><a href='#f436' class='c016'><sup>[436]</sup></a> Such securities are of two kinds, which may
be distinguished as mortgages and liens, if we use the latter
term in its widest permissible sense.<a id='r437'></a><a href='#f437' class='c016'><sup>[437]</sup></a> In considering the
nature of this distinction we must first notice a plausible
but erroneous explanation. A mortgage, it is sometimes
said, is a security created by the <em>transfer</em> of the debtor’s property
to the creditor, while a lien is merely an encumbrance
of some sort created in favour of the creditor over property
which remains vested in the debtor; a mortgagee is the
owner of the property, while a pledgee or other lienee is
merely an encumbrancer of it. This, however, is not a
strictly accurate account of the matter, though it is true in
the great majority of cases. A mortgage may be created by
way of encumbrance, no less than by way of transfer;<a id='r438'></a><a href='#f438' class='c016'><sup>[438]</sup></a> and
a mortgagee does not necessarily become the owner of the
property mortgaged. A lease, for example, is commonly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>mortgaged, not by the assignment of it, but by the grant of
a sub-lease to the creditor, so that the mortgagee becomes
not the owner of the lease but an encumbrancer of it.
Similarly freehold land may be mortgaged by the grant to
the mortgagee of a long term of years.</p>

<p class='c006'>Inasmuch, therefore, as a mortgage is not necessarily the
transfer of the property to the creditor, what is its essential
characteristic? The question is one of considerable difficulty,
but the true solution is apparently this. A lien is a
right which is <em>in its own nature</em> a security for a debt and
nothing more; for example, a right to retain possession of a
chattel until payment, a right to distrain for rent, or a right
to receive payment out of a certain fund. A mortgage, on
the contrary, is a right which is in its own nature an independent
or principal right, and not a mere security for another
right, but which is artificially cut down and limited, so that it
may serve in the particular case as a security and nothing
more; for example the fee simple of land, a lease of land for
a term of years, or the ownership of a chattel. The right of
the lienee is vested in him <em>absolutely</em>, and not merely by way
of security; for it is itself nothing more than a security.
The right of a mortgagee, on the contrary, is vested in him
conditionally and <em>by way of security only</em>, for it is in itself
something more than a mere security. A lien cannot survive
the debt secured; it ceases and determines <i><span lang="la">ipso jure</span></i> on the
extinction of the debt. It is merely the shadow, so to speak,
cast by the debt upon the property of the debtor. But the
right vested in a mortgagee has an independent existence.
It will, or may, remain outstanding in the mortgagee even
after the extinction of the debt. When thus left outstanding,
it must be re-transferred or surrendered to the mortgagor,
and the right of the mortgagor to this re-assignment or
surrender is called his right or equity of redemption. The
existence of such an equity of redemption is therefore the test
of a mortgage. In liens there is no such right, for there is
nothing to redeem. The creditor owns no right which he
can be bound to give back or surrender to his debtor. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>his right of security has come to its natural and necessary
termination with the termination of the right secured.<a id='r439'></a><a href='#f439' class='c016'><sup>[439]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mortgages are created either by the transfer of the debtor’s
right to the creditor, or by the encumbrance of it in his
favour. The first of these methods is by far the more usual
and important. Moreover it is peculiar to mortgages, for
liens can be created only by way of encumbrance. Whenever
a debtor <em>transfers</em> his right to the creditor by way of security,
the result is necessarily a mortgage; for there can be no
connexion between the duration of the debt so secured and
the natural duration of the right so transferred. The right
transferred may survive the debt, and the debtor therefore
retains the right of redemption which is the infallible test
of a mortgage. When on the other hand a debtor <em>encumbers</em>
his right in favour of the creditor, the security so created is
either a mortgage or a lien according to circumstances. It
is a mortgage, if the encumbrance so created is independent
of the debt secured in respect of its natural duration; for
example a term of years or a permanent servitude. It is a
lien, if the encumbrance is in respect of its natural duration
dependent on, and coincident with the debt secured; for
example a pledge, a vendor’s lien, a landlord’s right of distress,
or an equitable charge on a fund.</p>

<p class='c007'>Speaking generally, any alienable and valuable right whatever
may be the subject-matter of a mortgage. Whatever
can be transferred can be transferred by way of mortgage;
whatever can be encumbered can be encumbered by way of
mortgage. Whether I own land, or chattels, or debts, or
shares, or patents, or copyrights, or leases, or servitudes, or
equitable interests in trust funds, or the benefit of a contract,
I may so deal with them as to constitute a valid mortgage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>security. Even a mortgage itself may be transferred by the
mortgagee to some creditor of his own by way of mortgage,
such a mortgage of a mortgage being known as a sub-mortgage.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a mortgage by way of transfer the debtor, though he
assigns the property to his creditor, remains none the less the
beneficial or equitable owner of it himself. A mortgagor, by
virtue of his equity of redemption, has more than a mere
personal right against the mortgagee to the reconveyance of
the property; he is already the beneficial owner of it. This
double ownership of mortgaged property is merely a special
form of trust. The mortgagee holds in trust for the mortgagor,
and has himself no beneficial interest, save so far as is
required for the purposes of an effective security. On the
payment or extinction of the debt the mortgagee becomes a
mere trustee and nothing more; the ownership remains
vested in him, but is now bare of any vestige of beneficial
interest. A mortgage, therefore, has a double aspect and
nature. Viewed in respect of the <i><span lang="la">nudum dominium</span></i> vested in
the mortgagee, it is a transfer of the property; viewed in
respect of the beneficial ownership which remains vested in
the mortgagor, it is merely an encumbrance of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prominence of mortgage as the most important form
of security is a peculiarity of English law. In Roman law,
and in the modern Continental systems based upon it, the
place assumed by mortgages in our system is taken by the lien
(<i><span lang="la">hypotheca</span></i>) in its various forms. The Roman mortgage
(<i><span lang="la">fiducia</span></i>) fell wholly out of use before the time of Justinian,
having been displaced by the superior simplicity and convenience
of the <i><span lang="la">hypotheca</span></i>; and in this respect modern
Continental law has followed the Roman. There can be no
doubt that a similar substitution of the lien for the mortgage
would immensely simplify and improve the law of England.
The complexity and difficulty of the English law of security—due
entirely to the adoption of the system of mortgages—must
be a source of amazement to a French or German
lawyer. Whatever can be done by way of mortgage in
securing a debt can be done equally well by way of lien,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>and the lien avoids all that extraordinary disturbance and
complication of legal relations which is essentially involved
in the mortgage. The best type of security is that which combines
the most efficient protection of the creditor with the
least interference with the rights of the debtor, and in this
latter respect the mortgage falls far short of the ideal. The
true form of security is a lien, leaving the full legal and
equitable ownership in the debtor, but vesting in the creditor
such rights and powers (as of sale, possession, and so forth)
as are required, according to the nature of the subject-matter,
to give the creditor sufficient protection, and lapsing
<i><span lang="la">ipso jure</span></i> with the discharge of the debt secured.<a id='r440'></a><a href='#f440' class='c016'><sup>[440]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>Liens are of various kinds, none of which present any difficulty or
require any special consideration.</p>

<p class='c019'>1. <em>Possessory liens</em>—consisting in the right to retain possession of
chattels or other property of the debtor. A power of sale may or may
not be combined with this right of possession. Examples are pledges of
chattels, and the liens of innkeepers, solicitors, and vendors of goods.</p>

<p class='c019'>2. <em>Rights of distress or seizure</em>—consisting in the right to take possession
of the property of the debtor, with or without a power of sale.
Examples are the right of distress for rent, and the right of the occupier
of land to distrain cattle trespassing on it.</p>

<p class='c019'>3. <em>Powers of sale.</em> This is a form of security seldom found in isolation,
for it is usually incidental to the right of possession conferred by one or
other of the two preceding forms of lien. There is no reason, however,
why it should not in itself form an effective security.</p>

<p class='c019'>4. <em>Powers of forfeiture</em>—consisting in a power vested in the creditor of
destroying in his own interest some adverse right vested in the debtor.
Examples are a landlord’s right of re-entry upon his tenant, and a vendor’s
right of forfeiting the deposit paid by the purchaser.</p>

<p class='c019'>5. <em>Charges</em>—consisting in the right of a creditor to receive payment out
of some specific fund or out of the proceeds of the realisation of specific
property. The fund or property is said to be charged with the debt
which is thus payable out of it.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 161. <b>Modes of Acquisition: Possession.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Having considered the various forms which proprietary
rights <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i> assume, we proceed to examine the modes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>their acquisition. An attempt to give a complete list of
these titles would here serve no useful purpose, and we shall
confine our attention to four of them which are of primary
importance. These are the following: Possession, Prescription,
Agreement, and Inheritance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The possession of a material object is a title to the ownership
of it. The <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> relation between person and thing
brings the <i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i> relation along with it. He who claims a
chattel or a piece of land as his, and makes good his claim
in <em>fact</em> by way of possession, makes it good in <em>law</em> also by
way of ownership. There is, however, an important distinction
to be drawn. For the thing so possessed may, or may
not, already belong to some other person. If, when possession
of it is taken by the claimant, it is as yet the property of
no one—<i><span lang="la">res nullius</span></i> as the Romans said—the possessor acquires
a title good against all the world. The fish of the sea
and the fowls of the air belong by an absolute title to him who
first succeeds in obtaining possession of them. This mode of
acquisition is known in Roman law as <i><span lang="la">occupatio</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, the thing of which possession is taken
may already be the property of some one else. In this case
the title acquired by possession is good, indeed, against all
third persons, but is of no validity at all against the true
owner. Possession, even when consciously wrongful, is
allowed as a title of right against all persons who cannot show
a better, because a prior, title in themselves. Save with
respect to the rights of the original proprietor, my rights to
the watch in my pocket are much the same, whether I bought
it honestly, or found it, or abstracted it from the pocket of
some one else. If it is stolen from me, the law will help me
to the recovery of it. I can effectually sell it, lend it, give
it away, or bequeath it, and it will go on my death intestate
to my next of kin. Whoever acquires it from me, however,
acquires in general nothing save my limited and imperfect
title to it, and holds it, as I do, subject to the superior
claims of the original owner.</p>

<p class='c007'>A thing owned by one man and thus adversely possessed
by another has in truth two owners. The ownership of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>one is absolute and perfect, while that of the other is relative
and imperfect, and is often called, by reason of its origin in
possession, possessory ownership.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a possessory owner is wrongfully deprived of the thing by
a person other than the true owner, he can recover it. For
the defendant cannot set up as a defence his own possessory
title, since it is later than, and consequently inferior to, the
possessory title of the plaintiff. Nor can he set up as a
defence the title of the true owner—the <i><span lang="la">jus tertii</span></i>, as it is
called; the plaintiff has a better, because an earlier, title
than the defendant, and it is irrelevant that the title of some
other person, not a party to the suit, is better still. The
expediency of this doctrine of possessory ownership is clear.
Were it not for such a rule, force and fraud would be left to
determine all disputes as to possession, between persons of
whom neither could show an unimpeachable title to the thing
as the true owner of it.<a id='r441'></a><a href='#f441' class='c016'><sup>[441]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 162. <b>Prescription.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Prescription<a id='r442'></a><a href='#f442' class='c016'><sup>[442]</sup></a> may be defined as the effect of lapse of time
in creating and destroying rights; it is the operation of time
as a vestitive fact. It is of two kinds, namely (1) positive
or acquisitive prescription and (2) negative or extinctive
prescription. The former is the creation of a right, the latter
is the destruction of one, by the lapse of time. An example
of the former is the acquisition of a right of way by the <i><span lang="la">de
facto</span></i> use of it for twenty years. An instance of the latter is
the destruction of the right to sue for a debt after six years
from the time at which it first became payable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lapse of time, therefore, has two opposite effects. In
positive prescription it is a title of right, but in negative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>prescription it is a divestitive fact. Whether it shall operate
in the one way or in the other depends on whether it is or is
not accompanied by <em>possession</em>. Positive prescription is the
investitive operation of lapse of time <em>with</em> possession, while
negative prescription is the divestitive operation of lapse of
time <em>without</em> possession. Long possession creates rights, and
long want of possession destroys them. If I possess an
easement for twenty years without owning it, I begin at the
end of that period to own as well as to possess it. Conversely
if I own land for twelve years without possessing it, I cease
on the termination of that period either to own or to possess
it. In both forms of prescription, fact and right, possession
and ownership, tend to coincidence. <i><span lang="la">Ex facto oritur jus.</span></i> If
the root of fact is destroyed, the right growing out of it
withers and dies in course of time. If the fact is present, the
right will in the fulness of time proceed from it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In many cases the two forms of prescription coincide. The
property which one person loses through long dispossession is
often at the same time acquired by some one else through
long possession. Yet this is not always so, and it is necessary
in many instances to know whether legal effect is given to
long possession, in which case the prescription is positive, or
to long want of possession, in which case the prescription is
negative. I may, for example, be continuously out of possession
of my land for twelve years, without any other single
person having continuously held possession of it for that
length of time. It may have been in the hands of a series
of trespassers against me and against each other. In this
case, if the legally recognised form of prescription is positive,
it is inoperative, and I retain my ownership. But if the
law recognises negative prescription instead of positive (as in
this case our own system does) my title will be extinguished.
Who in such circumstances will acquire the right which I
thus lose, depends not on the law of prescription, but on the
rules as to the acquisition of things which have no owner.
The doctrine that prior possession is a good title against all
but the true owner, will confer on the first of a series of adverse
possessors a good title against all the world so soon as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>title of the true owner has been extinguished by negative
prescription.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rational basis of prescription is to be found in the
presumption of the coincidence of possession and ownership,
of fact and of right. Owners are usually possessors, and
possessors are usually owners. Fact and right are normally
coincident; therefore the former is evidence of the latter.
That a thing is possessed <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> is evidence that it is owned
<i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i>. That it is not possessed raises a presumption that
it is not owned either. Want of possession is evidence of
want of title. The longer the possession or want of possession
has continued, the greater is its evidential value. That
I have occupied land for a day raises a very slight presumption
that I am the owner of it; but if I continue to occupy
it for twenty years, the presumption becomes indefinitely
stronger. If I have a claim of debt against a man, unfulfilled
and unenforced, the lapse of six months may have but little
weight as evidence that my claim is unfounded or that it
has been already satisfied; but the lapse of ten years may
amount to ample proof of this.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, therefore, I am in possession of anything in which I
claim a right, I have evidence of my right which differs from
all other evidence, inasmuch as it grows stronger instead of
weaker with the lapse of years. The tooth of time may eat
away all other proofs of title. Documents are lost, memory
fails, witnesses die. But as these become of no avail, an
efficient substitute is in the same measure provided by the
probative force of long possession. So also with long want
of possession as evidence of want of title; as the years pass,
the evidence in favour of the title fades, while the presumption
against it grows ever stronger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here, then, we have the chief foundation of the law of
prescription. For in this case, as in so many others, the law
has deemed it expedient to confer upon a certain species of
evidence conclusive force. It has established a conclusive
presumption in favour of the rightfulness of long possession,
and against the validity of claims which are vitiated by long
want of possession. Lapse of time is recognised as creative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>and destructive of rights, instead of merely as evidence for
and against their existence. In substance, though not always
in form, prescription has been advanced from the law of
evidence to a place in the substantive law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conclusive presumption on which prescription is thus
founded falls, like all other conclusive presumptions, more
or less wide of the truth. Yet in the long run, if used with
due safeguards, it is the instrument of justice. It is not true
as a matter of fact that a claim unenforced for six years is
always unfounded, but it may be wise for the law to act as
if it were true. For the effect of thus exaggerating the evidential
value of lapse of time is to prevent the persons concerned
from permitting such delays as would render their
claims in reality doubtful. In order to avoid the difficulty
and error that necessarily result from the lapse of time, the
presumption of the coincidence of fact and right is rightly
accepted as final after a certain number of years. Whoever
wishes to dispute this presumption must do so within that
period; otherwise his right, if he has one, will be forfeited as
a penalty for his neglect. <i><span lang="la">Vigilantibus non dormientibus jura
subveniunt.</span></i></p>

<p class='c007'>Prescription is not limited to rights <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i>. It is found
within the sphere of obligations as well as within that of
property. Positive prescription, however, is possible only in
the case of rights which admit of possession—that is to say,
continuing exercise and enjoyment. Most rights of this
nature are rights <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i>. Rights <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i> are commonly
extinguished by their exercise, and therefore cannot be
possessed or acquired by prescription. And even in that
minority of cases in which such rights do admit of possession,
and in which positive prescription is therefore theoretically
possible, modern law, at least, has seen no occasion
for allowing it. This form of prescription, therefore, is peculiar
to the law of property. Negative prescription, on the
other hand, is common to the law of property and to that of
obligations. Most obligations are destroyed by the lapse of
time, for since the ownership of them cannot be accompanied
by the possession of them, there is nothing to preserve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>them from the destructive influence of delay in their enforcement.<a id='r443'></a><a href='#f443' class='c016'><sup>[443]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Negative prescription is of two kinds, which may be distinguished
as perfect and imperfect. The latter is commonly
called the limitation of actions, the former being then distinguished
as prescription in a narrow and specific sense. Perfect
prescription is the destruction of the principal right itself,
while imperfect prescription is merely the destruction of the
accessory <em>right of action</em>, the principal right remaining in
existence. In other words, in the one case the right is
wholly destroyed, but in the other it is merely reduced from
a perfect and enforceable right to one which is imperfect and
unenforceable.</p>

<p class='c007'>An example of perfect prescription is the destruction of
the ownership of land through dispossession for twelve years.
The owner of land who has been out of possession for that
period does not merely lose his right of action for the recovery
of it, but also loses the right of ownership itself. An
example of imperfect prescription, on the other hand, is the
case of the owner of a chattel who has been out of possession
of it for six years. He loses his right of action for the
recovery of it, but he remains the owner of it none the less.
His ownership is reduced from a perfect to an imperfect right,
but it still subsists. Similarly a creditor loses in six years
his right of action for the debt; but the debt itself is not
extinguished, and continues to be due and owing.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 163. <b>Agreement.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>We have already considered the general theory of agreement
as a title of right. It will be remembered that we used
the term to include not merely contracts but all other
bilateral acts in the law, that is to say, all expressions of the
consenting wills of two or more persons directed to an
alteration of their legal relations. Agreement in this wide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>sense is no less important in the law of property than in that
of obligations.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a title of proprietary rights <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i>, agreement is of two
kinds, namely assignment and grant. By the former, existing
rights are transferred from one owner to another; by the
latter, new rights are created by way of encumbrance upon
the existing rights of the grantor. The grant of a lease of
land is the creation by agreement, between grantor and
grantee, of a leasehold vested in the latter and encumbering
the freehold vested in the former. The assignment
of a lease, on the other hand, is the transfer by agreement
of a subsisting leasehold from the assignor to the
assignee.</p>

<p class='c007'>Agreement is either formal or informal. We have already
sufficiently considered the significance of this formal element
in general. There is, however, one formality known to the
law of property which requires special notice, namely, the
delivery of possession. That <i><span lang="la">traditio</span></i> was an essential element
in the voluntary transfer of <i><span lang="la">dominium</span></i> was a fundamental
principle of Roman law. <i><span lang="la">Traditionibus et usucapionibus
dominia rerum, non nudis pactis transferuntur.</span></i><a id='r444'></a><a href='#f444' class='c016'><sup>[444]</sup></a> So in
English law, until the year 1845, land could in theory be
conveyed in no other method than by the delivery of
possession. No deed of conveyance was in itself of any
effect. It is true that in practice this rule was for centuries
evaded by taking advantage of that fictitious delivery of
possession which was rendered possible by the Statute of
Uses. But it is only by virtue of a modern statute,<a id='r445'></a><a href='#f445' class='c016'><sup>[445]</sup></a> passed
in the year mentioned, that the ownership of land can in
legal theory be transferred without the possession of it. In
the case of chattels the common law itself succeeded,
centuries ago, in cutting down to a very large extent the
older principle. Chattels can be assigned by deed without
delivery, and also by sale without delivery. But a <em>gift</em> of
chattels requires to this day to be completed by the transfer
of possession.<a id='r446'></a><a href='#f446' class='c016'><sup>[446]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>In this requirement of <i><span lang="la">traditio</span></i> we may see a curious
remnant of an earlier phase of thought. It is a relic of the
times when the law attributed to the fact of possession a
degree of importance which at the present day seems altogether
disproportionate. Ownership seems to have been
deemed little more than an accessory of possession. An
owner who had ceased to possess had almost ceased to own,
for he was deprived of his most important rights. A person
who had not yet succeeded in obtaining possession was not
an owner at all, however valid his claim to the possession
may have been. The transfer of a thing was conceived as
consisting essentially in the transfer of the possession of it.
The transfer of <em>rights</em>, apart from the visible transfer of <em>things</em>,
had not yet been thought of.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far as the requirement of <i><span lang="la">traditio</span></i> is still justifiably
retained by the law, it is to be regarded as a formality
accessory to the agreement, and serving the same purposes
as other formalities. It supplies evidence of the agreement,
and it preserves for the parties a <i><span lang="la">locus poenitentiae</span></i>, lest they
be prematurely bound by unconsidered consent.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a leading principle of law that the title of a grantee
or assignee cannot be better than that of his grantor or
assignor. <i><span lang="la">Nemo plus juris ad alium transferre potest, quam
ipse haberet.</span></i><a id='r447'></a><a href='#f447' class='c016'><sup>[447]</sup></a> No man can transfer or encumber a right
which is not his. To this rule, however, there is a considerable
number of important exceptions. The rule is
ancient, and most of the exceptions are modern; and we
may anticipate that the future course of legal development
will show further derogations from the early principle.
There are two conflicting interests in the matter. The older
rule is devised for the security of established titles. Under
its protection he who succeeds in obtaining a perfect title
may sit down in peace and keep his property against all the
world. The exceptions, on the contrary, are established in
the interests of those who seek to <em>acquire</em> property, not of
those who seek to <em>keep</em> it. The easier it is to acquire a title
with safety, the more difficult it is to keep one in safety; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>the law must make a compromise between these two adverse
interests. The modern tendency is more and more to
sacrifice the security of tenure given by the older rule, to
the facilities for safe and speedy acquisition and disposition
given by the exceptions to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>These exceptions are of two kinds: (1) those due to the
separation of legal from equitable ownership, and (2) those
due to the separation of ownership from possession. We
have seen already that when the legal ownership is in one
man and the equitable in another, the legal owner is a
trustee for the equitable. He holds the property on behalf
of that other, and not for himself; and the obligation of this
trusteeship is an encumbrance upon his title. Yet he may,
none the less, give an unencumbered title to a third person,
provided that that person gives value for what he gets, and
has at the time no knowledge of the existence of the trust.
This rule is known as the equitable doctrine of purchase for
value without notice. No man who ignorantly and honestly
purchases a defective legal title can be affected by any
adverse equitable title vested in any one else. To this extent
a legal owner can transfer to another more than he has
himself, notwithstanding the maxim, <i><span lang="la">Nemo dat quod non
habet</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second class of exceptions to the general principle
includes the cases in which the possession of a thing is in one
person and the ownership of it in another. Partly by the
common law, and partly by various modern statutes, the
possessor is in certain cases enabled to give a good title to
one who deals with him in good faith believing him to be
the owner. The law allows men in these cases to act on the
presumption that the possessor of a thing is the owner of it;
and he who honestly acts on this presumption will acquire
a valid title in all events. The most notable example is the
case of negotiable instruments. The possessor of a bank-note
may have no title to it; he may have found it or stolen it;
but he can give a good title to any one who takes it from him
for value and in good faith. Similarly mercantile agents,
in possession of goods belonging to their principals, can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>effectively transfer the ownership of them,<a id='r448'></a><a href='#f448' class='c016'><sup>[448]</sup></a> whether they are
authorised thereto or not.<a id='r449'></a><a href='#f449' class='c016'><sup>[449]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 164. <b>Inheritance.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The fourth and last mode of acquisition that we need
consider is Inheritance. In respect of the death of their
owners all rights are divisible into two classes, being either
inheritable or uninheritable. A right is inheritable, if it
survives its owner; uninheritable, if it dies with him. This
division is to a large extent, though far from completely,
coincident with that between proprietary and personal rights.
The latter are in almost all cases so intimately connected
with the personality of him in whom they are vested, that
they are incapable of separate and continued existence.
They are not merely <em>divested</em> by death (as are rights of every
sort), but are wholly <em>extinguished</em>. In exceptional cases,
however, this is not so. Some personal rights are inheritable,
just as property is, an instance being the status of
hereditary nobility and the political and other privileges
accessory thereto.</p>

<p class='c007'>Proprietary rights, on the other hand, are usually inheritable.
In respect of them death is a divestitive, but not
an extinctive fact. The exceptions, however, are numerous.
A lease may be for the life of the lessee instead of for a fixed
term of years. Joint ownership is such that the right of him
who dies first is wholly destroyed, the survivor acquiring an
exclusive title by the <i><span lang="la">jus accrescendi</span></i> or right of survivorship.
Rights of action for a tort die with the person wronged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>except so far as the rule of the common law has been altered
by statute. In the great majority of cases, however, death
destroys merely the ownership of a proprietary right, and not
the right itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rights which a dead man thus leaves behind him vest
in his <em>representative</em>. They pass to some person whom the
dead man, or the law on his behalf, has appointed to represent
him in the world of the living. This representative bears
the person of the deceased, and therefore has vested in him
all the inheritable rights, and has imposed upon him all the
inheritable liabilities of the deceased. Inheritance is in some
sort a legal and fictitious continuation of the personality of
the dead man, for the representative is in some sort identified
by the law with him whom he represents. The rights which
the dead man can no longer own or exercise <i><span lang="la">in propria persona</span></i>,
and the obligations which he can no longer <i><span lang="la">in propria
persona</span></i> fulfil, he owns, exercises, and fulfils in the person of a
living substitute. To this extent, and in this fashion, it
may be said that the legal personality of a man survives his
natural personality, until, his obligations being duly performed,
and his property duly disposed of, his representation
among the living is no longer called for.<a id='r450'></a><a href='#f450' class='c016'><sup>[450]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The representative of a dead man, though the property of
the deceased is vested in him, is not necessarily the beneficial
owner of it. He holds it on behalf of two classes of persons,
among whom he himself may or may not be numbered.
These are the creditors and the beneficiaries of the estate.
Just as many of a man’s rights survive him, so also do many
of his liabilities; and these inheritable obligations pass to
his representative, and must be satisfied by him. Being,
however, merely the representative of another, he is not
liable <i><span lang="la">in propria persona</span></i>, and his responsibility is limited
by the amount of the property which he has acquired from
the deceased. He possesses a double personality or capacity,
and that which is due from him in right of his executorship
cannot be recovered from him in his own right.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>The beneficiaries, who are entitled to the residue after
satisfaction of the creditors, are of two classes: (1) those
nominated by the last will of the deceased, and (2) those
appointed by the law in default of any such nomination.
The succession of the former is testamentary (<i><span lang="la">ex testamento</span></i>);
that of the latter is intestate (<i><span lang="la">ab intestato</span></i>). As to the latter there
is nothing that need here be said, save that the law is chiefly
guided by the presumed desires of the dead man, and confers
the estate upon his relatives in order of proximity. In default
of any known relatives the property of an intestate is claimed
by the state itself, and goes as <i><span lang="la">bona vacantia</span></i> to the Crown.</p>

<p class='c007'>Testamentary succession, on the other hand, demands
further consideration. Although a dead man has no rights,
a man while yet alive has the right to determine the disposition
after he is dead of the property which he leaves
behind him. His last will, duly declared in the document
which we significantly call by that name, is held inviolable
by the law. For half a century and more, the rights and
responsibilities of living men may thus be determined by an
instrument which was of no effect until the author of it was
in his grave and had no longer any concern with the world
or its affairs. This power of the dead hand (<i><span lang="la">mortua manus</span></i>)
is so familiar a feature in the law, that we accept it as a
matter of course, and have some difficulty in realising what
a very singular phenomenon it in reality is.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is clear that some limitation must be imposed by the
law upon this power of the dead over the living, and these
restrictions are of three chief kinds:</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) <em>Limitations of time.</em> It is only during a limited period
after his death, that the directions of a testator as to the
disposition of his property are held valid. He must so order
the destination of his estate that within this period the whole
of it shall become vested absolutely in some one or more
persons, free from all testamentary conditions and restrictions.
Any attempt to retain the property <i><span lang="la">in manu mortua</span></i>
beyond that limit makes the testamentary disposition of it
void. In English law the period is determined by a set of
elaborate rules which we need not here consider.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>(2) <em>Limitations of amount.</em> A second limitation of testamentary
power, imposed by most legal systems, though not
by our own, is that a testator can deal with a certain proportion
of his estate only, the residue being allotted by the law
to those to whom he owes a duty of support, namely his wife
and children.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) <em>Limitations of purpose.</em> The power of testamentary
disposition is given to a man that he may use it for the
benefit of other men who survive him; and to this end only
can it be validly exercised. The dead hand will not be
suffered to withdraw property from the uses of the living.
No man can validly direct that his lands shall lie waste, or
that his money, shall be buried with him, or thrown into
the sea.<a id='r451'></a><a href='#f451' class='c016'><sup>[451]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI.<br> <span class='c013'>THE LAW OF OBLIGATIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 165. <b>The Nature of Obligations.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Obligation in its popular sense is merely a synonym for
duty. Its legal sense, derived from Roman law, differs from
this in several respects. In the first place, obligations are
merely one class of duties, namely those which are the correlatives
of rights <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>. An obligation is the <i><span lang="la">vinculum
juris</span></i>, or bond of legal necessity, which binds together two or
more determinate individuals.<a id='r452'></a><a href='#f452' class='c016'><sup>[452]</sup></a> It includes, for example, the
duty to pay a debt, to perform a contract, or to pay damages
for a tort, but not the duty to refrain from interference with
the person, property, or reputation of others. Secondly, the
term obligation is in law the name not merely of the duty, but
also of the correlative right. It denotes the legal relation or
<i><span lang="la">vinculum juris</span></i> in its entirety, including the right of the one
party, no less than the liability of the other. Looked at from
the point of view of the person entitled, an obligation is a
right; looked at from the point of view of the person bound,
it is a duty. We may say either that the creditor acquires,
owns, or transfers an obligation, or that the debtor has incurred
or been released from one. Thirdly and lastly, all
obligations pertain to the sphere of <em>proprietary</em> rights. They
form part of the estate of him who is entitled to them.
Rights which relate to a person’s <em>status</em>, such as those created
by marriage, are not obligations, even though they are rights
<i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>. An obligation, therefore, may be defined as a
proprietary right <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i> or a duty which corresponds
to such a right.</p>

<p class='c007'>The person entitled to the benefit of an <i><span lang="la">obligatio</span></i> was in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>Roman law termed <i><span lang="la">creditor</span></i>, while he who was bound by it was
called <i><span lang="la">debitor</span></i>. We may venture to use the corresponding
English terms creditor and debtor in an equally wide sense.
We shall speak of every obligation, of whatever nature, as
vested in or belonging to a creditor, and availing against a
debtor. There is, of course, a narrower sense, in which these
terms are applicable only to those obligations which constitute
<em>debts</em>; that is to say, obligations to pay a definite or
liquidated sum of money.</p>

<p class='c007'>A technical synonym for obligation is <em>chose in action</em> or
<em>thing in action</em>. A chose in action means, in our modern use
of it, a proprietary right <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>; for example, a debt,
a share in a joint-stock company, money in the public funds,
or a claim for damages for a tort. A non-proprietary right
<i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>, such as that which arises from a contract to
marry, or from the contract of marriage, is no more a chose
in action in English law than it is an <i><span lang="la">obligatio</span></i> in Roman law.</p>

<p class='c019'>Choses in action are opposed to choses in possession, though the latter
term has all but fallen out of use. The true nature of the distinction
thus expressed has been the subject of much discussion. At the present
day, if any logical validity at all is to be ascribed to it, it must be identified
with that between real and personal rights, that is to say, with the Roman
distinction between <i><span lang="la">dominium</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">obligatio</span></i>. A chose in action is a
proprietary right <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>. All other proprietary rights (including
such objects of rights as are identified with the rights themselves) are
choses in possession. If we regard the matter historically, however, it
becomes clear that this is not the original meaning of the distinction. In
its origin a chose in possession was any thing or right which was accompanied
by <em>possession</em>; while a chose in action was any thing or right of
which the claimant had no possession, but which he must obtain, if need
be, by way of an <em>action</em> at law. Money in a man’s purse was a thing in
possession; money due to him by a debtor was a thing in action. This
distinction was largely, though not wholly, coincident with that between
real and personal rights, for real rights are commonly possessed as well
as owned, while personal rights are commonly owned but not possessed.
This coincidence, however, was not complete. A chattel, for example,
stolen from its owner was reduced, so far as he was concerned, to a thing
in action; but his right of ownership was not thereby reduced to a mere
<i><span lang="la">obligatio</span></i>.<a id='r453'></a><a href='#f453' class='c016'><sup>[453]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>The extraordinary importance attributed to the fact of possession was
a characteristic feature of our early law. As this importance diminished,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>the original significance of the distinction between things in possession
and things in action was lost sight of, and these terms gradually acquired
a new meaning. Originally shares and annuities would probably have
been classed as things in possession, but they are now things in action.
Conversely lands and chattels are now things in possession, whether the
owner retains possession of them or not. Obligations were always the
most important species of things in action, and they are now the only
species. Neither the old law nor the new gives any countenance to the
suggestion made by some that immaterial property, such as patents,
copyrights, and trade-marks, should be classed as choses in action.<a id='r454'></a><a href='#f454' class='c016'><sup>[454]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 166. <b>Solidary Obligations.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The normal type of obligation is that in which there is one
creditor and one debtor. It often happens, however, that
there are two or more creditors entitled to the same obligation,
or two or more debtors under the same liability. The
case of two or more creditors gives rise to little difficulty, and
requires no special consideration. It is, in most respects,
merely a particular instance of co-ownership, the co-owners
holding either jointly or in common, according to circumstances.
The case of two or more debtors, however, is of
some theoretical interest, and calls for special notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Examples of it are debts owing by a firm of partners, debts
owing by a principal debtor and guaranteed by one or more
sureties, and the liability of two or more persons who together
commit a tort. In all such cases each debtor is liable for the
whole amount due. The creditor is not obliged to divide his
claim into as many different parts as there are debtors. He
may exact the whole sum from one, and leave that one to
recover from his co-debtors, if possible and permissible, a just
proportion of the amount so paid. A debt of £100 owing by
two partners, A. and B., is not equivalent to one debt of £50
owing by A. and another of the same amount owing by B. It
is a single debt of £100 owing by each of them, in such fashion
that each of them may be compelled to pay the whole of it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>but that when it is once paid by either of them, both are discharged
from it.<a id='r455'></a><a href='#f455' class='c016'><sup>[455]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Obligations of this description may be called solidary, since
in the language of Roman law, each of the debtors is bound
<i><span lang="la">in solidum</span></i> instead of <i><span lang="la">pro parte</span></i>; that is to say, for the whole,
and not for a proportionate part. A solidary obligation,
therefore, may be defined as one in which two or more
debtors owe the same thing to the same creditor. In English
law they are of three distinct kinds, being either (1) several,
(2) joint, or (3) joint and several.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Solidary obligations are several, when, although the
thing owed is the same in each case, there are as many distinct
obligations and causes of action, as there are debtors. Each
debtor is bound to the creditor by a distinct and independent
<i><span lang="la">vinculum juris</span></i>, the only connexion between them being that
in each case the subject-matter of the obligation is the same,
so that performance by one of the debtors necessarily discharges
all the others also.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Solidary obligations are joint, on the other hand, when,
though there are two or more debtors, there is only one debt
or other cause of action, as well as only one thing owed. The
<i><span lang="la">vinculum juris</span></i> is single, though it binds several debtors to the
same creditor. The chief effect of this unity of the obligation
is that all the debtors are discharged by anything which discharges
any one of them. When the <i><span lang="la">vinculum juris</span></i> has once
been severed as to any of them, it is severed as to all. Where,
on the contrary, solidary obligations are several and not joint,
performance by one debtor will release the others, but in all
other respects the different <i><span lang="la">vincula juris</span></i> are independent of
each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The third species of solidary obligation consists of those
which are both joint and several. As their name implies,
they stand half-way between the two extreme types which we
have already considered. They are the product of a compromise
between two competing principles. For some purposes
the law treats them as joint, and for other purposes as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>several. For some purposes there is in the eye of the law
only one single obligation and cause of action, while for other
purposes the law consents to recognise as many distinct
obligations and causes of action as there are debtors.</p>

<p class='c007'>On what principle, then, does the law determine the class
of which any solidary obligation belongs? Speaking generally,
we may say that such obligations are several, when,
although they have the same subject-matter, they have
different sources; they are several in their nature, if they are
distinct in their origin. They are joint, on the other hand,
when they have not merely the same subject-matter, but the
same source. Joint and several obligations, in the third
place, are those joint obligations which the law, for special
reasons, chooses to treat in special respects as if they were
several. Like those which are purely and simply joint, they
have the same source as well as the same subject-matter; but
the law does not regard them consistently as comprising a
single <i><span lang="la">vinculum juris</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c019'>The following are examples of solidary obligations which are several in
their nature:</p>

<p class='c019'>(1) The liability of a principal debtor and that of his surety, provided
that the contract of suretyship is subsequent to, or otherwise independent
of the creation of the debt so guaranteed. But if the two debts have the
same origin, as where the principal debtor and the surety sign a joint
bond, the case is one of joint obligation.</p>

<p class='c019'>(2) The liability of two or more co-sureties who guarantee the same
debt independently of each other.<a id='r456'></a><a href='#f456' class='c016'><sup>[456]</sup></a> They may make themselves joint, or
joint and several debtors, on the other hand, by joining in a single contract
of guarantee.</p>

<p class='c019'>(3) Separate judgments obtained in distinct actions against two or
more persons liable for the same debt. Two persons, for example, jointly
and severally liable on the same contract may be separately sued, and
judgment may be obtained against each of them. In such a case they
are no longer jointly liable at all; each is now severally liable for the
amount of his own judgment; but these two obligations are solidary,
inasmuch as the satisfaction of one will discharge the other.</p>

<p class='c019'>(4) The liability of independent wrongdoers whose acts cause the same
damage. This is a somewhat rare case, but is perfectly possible. Two
persons are not joint wrongdoers, simply because they both act wrongfully
and their acts unite to cause a single mischievous result. They must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>have committed a joint act; that is to say, they must have acted together
with some common purpose. If not, they may be liable <i><span lang="la">in solidum</span></i> and
severally for the common harm to which their separate acts contribute;
but they are not liable as joint wrongdoers. In <cite>Thompson</cite> v. <cite>The London
County Council</cite><a id='r457'></a><a href='#f457' class='c016'><sup>[457]</sup></a> the plaintiff’s house was injured by the subsidence of
its foundations, this subsidence resulting from excavations negligently
made by A., taken in conjunction with the negligence of B., a water
company, in leaving a water-main insufficiently stopped. It was held
that A. and B., inasmuch as their acts were quite independent of each
other, were not joint wrongdoers, and could not be joined in the same
action. It was said by Lord Justice Collins:<a id='r458'></a><a href='#f458' class='c016'><sup>[458]</sup></a> “The damage is one, but
the causes of action which have led to that damage are two, committed
by two distinct personalities.” The liability of the parties was solidary,
but not joint.<a id='r459'></a><a href='#f459' class='c016'><sup>[459]</sup></a> So also successive acts of wrongful conversion may be
committed by two or more persons in respect of the same chattel. Each
is liable in the action of trover to the owner of the chattel for its full value.
But they are liable severally, and not jointly. The owner may sue each
of them in different actions; though payment of the value by any one of
them will discharge the others.<a id='r460'></a><a href='#f460' class='c016'><sup>[460]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>Examples of joint obligations are the debts of partners, and all other
solidary obligations <i><span lang="la">ex contractu</span></i> which have not been expressly made
joint and several by the agreement of the parties.</p>

<p class='c019'>Examples of joint and several obligations are the liabilities of those
who jointly commit a tort or breach of trust, and also all contractual
obligations which are expressly made joint and several by the agreement
of the parties.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 167. <b>The Sources of Obligations.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Classed in respect of their sources or modes of origin, the
obligations recognised by English law are divisible into the
following four classes:</p>

  <dl class='dl_2'>
    <dt>(1)</dt>
    <dd>Contractual—<i><span lang="la">Obligationes ex contractu</span></i>.
    </dd>
    <dt>(2)</dt>
    <dd>Delictal—<i><span lang="la">Obligationes ex delicto</span></i>.
    </dd>
    <dt>(3)</dt>
    <dd>Quasi-contractual—<i><span lang="la">Obligationes quasi ex contractu</span></i>.
    </dd>
    <dt>(4)</dt>
    <dd>Innominate.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 168. <b>Obligations arising from Contracts.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The first and most important class of obligations consists
of those which are created by contract. We have in a former
chapter sufficiently considered the nature of a contract,<a id='r461'></a><a href='#f461' class='c016'><sup>[461]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>we there saw that it is that kind of agreement which creates
rights <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i> between the parties to it. Now of rights
<i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i> obligations are the most numerous and important
kind, and of those which are not obligations comparatively
few have their source in the agreement of the parties.
The law of contract, therefore, is almost wholly comprised
within the law of obligations, and for the practical purposes
of legal classification it may be placed there with sufficient
accuracy. The coincidence, indeed, is not logically complete:
a promise of marriage, for example, being a contract
which falls within the law of status, and not within that of
obligations. Neglecting, however, this small class of <em>personal</em>
contracts, the general theory of contract is simply a combination
of the general theory of agreement with that of obligation,
and does not call for any further examination in this
place.<a id='r462'></a><a href='#f462' class='c016'><sup>[462]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 169. <b>Obligations arising from Torts.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The second class of obligations consists of those which may
be termed delictal, or in the language of Roman law <i><span lang="la">obligationes
ex delicto</span></i>. By an obligation of this kind is meant
the duty of making pecuniary satisfaction for that species of
wrong which is known in English law as a <i><span lang="la">tort</span></i>. Etymologically
this term is merely the French equivalent of the
English wrong—tort (<i><span lang="la">tortum</span></i>), being that which is twisted,
crooked, or wrong; just as right (<i><span lang="la">rectum</span></i>) is that which is
straight. As a technical term of English law, however, tort
has become specialised in meaning, and now includes merely
one particular class of civil wrongs.</p>

<p class='c007'>A tort may be defined as a civil wrong, for which the
remedy is an action for damages, and which is not solely
the breach of a contract or the breach of a trust or other
merely equitable obligation. This definition contains four
essential elements, there being four kinds of wrongs excluded
by it from the sphere of tort.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. A tort is a civil wrong; crimes are wrongs, but are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>in themselves torts, though there is nothing to prevent the
same act from belonging to both these classes at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Even a civil wrong is not a tort, unless the appropriate
remedy for it is an action for damages. There are several
other forms of civil remedy besides this; for example, injunctions,
specific restitution of property, and the payment
of liquidated sums of money by way of penalty or otherwise.
Any civil injury which gives rise exclusively to one of these
other forms of remedy stands outside the class of torts. The
obstruction of a public highway, for example, is to be classed
as a civil injury, inasmuch as it may give rise to civil proceedings
instituted by the Attorney-General for an injunction;
but although a civil injury, it is not a tort, save in those
exceptional instances in which, by reason of special damage
suffered by an individual, it gives rise to an action for
damages at his suit.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. No civil wrong is a tort, if it is exclusively the breach
of a contract. The law of contracts stands by itself, as a
separate department of our legal system, over against the law
of torts; and to a large extent liability for breaches of contract
and liability for torts are governed by different principles.
It may well happen, however, that the same act is
both a tort and a breach of contract, and this is so in at least
two classes of cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>a</em>) The first and simplest of these is that in which a man
undertakes by contract the performance of a duty which lies
on him already, independently of any contract. Thus he
who refuses to return a borrowed chattel commits both a
breach of contract and also the tort known as conversion: a
breach of contract, because he promised expressly or impliedly
to return the chattel; but not <em>merely</em> a breach of contract,
and therefore also a tort, because he would have been equally
liable for detaining another man’s property, even if he had
made no such contract at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>b</em>) The second class of cases is one which involves considerable
difficulty, and the law on this point cannot yet be said
to have been thoroughly developed. In certain instances the
breach of a contract made with one person creates liability
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>towards another person, who is no party to the contract. It
is a fundamental principle, indeed, that no person can sue
on an <i><span lang="la">obligatio ex contractu</span></i>, except a party to the contract;
nevertheless it sometimes happens that one person can sue
<i><span lang="la">ex delicto</span></i> for the breach of a contract which was not made
with him, but from the breach of which he has suffered
unlawful damage. That is to say, a man may take upon
himself, by a contract with A., a duty which does not already
or otherwise rest upon him, but which, when it has once been
undertaken, he cannot break without doing such damage to
B., a third person, as the law deems actionable. Thus, if X.
lends his horse to Y., who delivers it to Z., a livery stablekeeper,
to be looked after and fed, and the horse is injured
or killed by insufficient feeding, presumably Z. is liable for
this, not only in contract to Y., but also in tort to X., the
owner of the horse. It is true that, apart from his contract
with Y., Z. was under no obligation to feed the animal; apart
from the contract, this was a mere omission to do an act
which he was not bound to do. Yet having taken this duty
upon himself, he has thereby put himself in such a situation
that he cannot break the duty without inflicting on the
owner of the horse damage of a kind which the law deems
wrongful. The omission to feed the horse, therefore, although
a breach of contract, is not exclusively such, and is
therefore a tort, inasmuch as it can be sued on by a person
who is no party to the contract. How far damage thus
caused to one man by the breach of a duty undertaken by
contract with another is actionable as a tort at the suit of the
former, is a question to be determined by the detailed rules
of the concrete legal system, and need not be here considered.<a id='r463'></a><a href='#f463' class='c016'><sup>[463]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>Before the abolition of forms of action the relation between contract
and tort was complicated and obscured by the existence of a class of
fictitious torts—wrongs which were in reality pure breaches of contract
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>and nothing more, and which nevertheless were remediable by delictal
forms of action. Forms of action were classed as either contractual or
delictal, but contractual actions were illogically allowed in cases in which
there was no true contract, but only a quasi-contract; and delictal actions
in cases in which there was no true tort, but a mere breach of contract.
There seems to be no longer any occasion for recognising the existence
of such quasi-torts, for they were merely a product of historical accident,
which may and should be now eliminated from the law. They are a
relic of the days when contractual remedies were so imperfectly developed
that they had to be supplemented by the use of delictal remedies in cases
of breach of contract. The contractual action of <i><span lang="la">assumpsit</span></i> is, in its
origin, merely a variant of the delictal action of <em>case</em>. It is not surprising,
therefore, that until the abolition of all forms of action, our law failed to
draw with accuracy the line between torts and breaches of contract.<a id='r464'></a><a href='#f464' class='c016'><sup>[464]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>4. The fourth and last class of wrongs which are not torts
consists of breaches of trusts or other equitable obligations.
The original reason for their exclusion and separate classification
is the historical fact, that the law of trusts and equitable
obligations originated and developed in the Court of
Chancery, and was wholly unknown to those courts of common
law in which the law of torts grew up. But even now,
although the distinction between law and equity is abolished,
it is still necessary to treat breaches of trust as a form of
wrong distinct from torts, and to deal with them along with
the law of trusts itself, just as breaches of contract are dealt
with along with the law of contract. Torts, contracts, and
trusts developed separately, the principles of liability in each
case are largely different, and they must be retained as distinct
departments of the law.</p>

<p class='c019'>By some writers a tort has been defined as the violation of a right <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i>,
giving rise to an obligation to pay damages. There is a tempting simplicity
and neatness in this application of the distinction between rights <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i>
and <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>, but it may be gravely doubted whether it does in truth
conform to the actual contents of the English law of torts. Most torts
undoubtedly are violations of rights <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i>, because most rights <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>
are created by contract. But there are rights <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i> which
are not contractual, and the violation of which, if it gives rise to an action
for damages, must be classed as a tort. The refusal of an innkeeper to
receive a guest is a tort, yet it is merely the breach of a non-contractual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>right <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>. So with any actionable refusal or neglect on the part
of a public official to perform his statutory duties on behalf of the
plaintiff.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 170. <b>Obligations arising from Quasi-Contracts.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>Both in Roman and in English law there are certain obligations
which are not in truth contractual, but which the law
treats as if they were. They are contractual in law, but not
in fact, being the subject-matter of a fictitious extension of
the sphere of contract to cover obligations which do not in
reality fall within it. The Romans called them <i><span lang="la">obligationes
quasi ex contractu</span></i>. English lawyers call them quasi-contracts
or implied contracts, or often enough contracts simply and
without qualification. We are told, for example, that a
judgment is a contract, and that a judgment debt is a contractual
obligation.<a id='r465'></a><a href='#f465' class='c016'><sup>[465]</sup></a> “Implied [contracts],” says Blackstone,<a id='r466'></a><a href='#f466' class='c016'><sup>[466]</sup></a>
“are such as reason and justice dictate, and which,
therefore, the law presumes that every man undertakes to
perform.” “Thus it is that every person is bound, and hath
virtually agreed, to pay such particular sums of money as are
charged on him by the sentence, or assessed by the interpretation,
of the law.”<a id='r467'></a><a href='#f467' class='c016'><sup>[467]</sup></a> So the same author speaks, much too
widely indeed, of the “general implication and intendment of
the courts of judicature that every man hath engaged to perform
what his duty or justice requires.”<a id='r468'></a><a href='#f468' class='c016'><sup>[468]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>From a quasi-contract, or contract implied in <em>law</em>, we must
carefully distinguish a contract implied in <i><span lang="la">fact</span></i>. The latter
is a true contract, though its existence is only inferred from
the conduct of the parties, instead of being expressed. Thus
when I enter an omnibus, I impliedly, yet actually agree to
pay the usual fare. A contract implied in law, on the contrary,
is merely fictitious, for the parties to it have not
agreed at all, either expressly or tacitly.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what cases, then, does the law recognise this fiction of
quasi-contract? What classes of obligations are regarded as
contractual in law, though they are not so in fact? To this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>question it is not possible to give any complete answer here.
We can, however, single out two classes of cases, which include
most, though not all, of the quasi-contractual obligations
known to English law.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. In the first place we may say in general, that in the
theory of the common law all <i><span lang="la">debts</span></i> are deemed to be contractual
in origin. A debt is an obligation to pay a liquidated
sum of money, as opposed to an obligation to pay an unliquidated
amount, and as opposed also to all non-pecuniary
obligations. Most debts are <i><span lang="la">obligationes ex contractu</span></i> in
truth and in fact, but there are many which have a different
source. A judgment creates a debt which is non-contractual;
so also does the receipt of money paid by mistake or obtained
by fraud. Nevertheless, in the eye of the common law they
all fall within the sphere of contract; for the law conclusively
presumes that every person who owes a debt has promised
to pay it. “Whatever, therefore,” says Blackstone,<a id='r469'></a><a href='#f469' class='c016'><sup>[469]</sup></a> “the
laws order any one to pay, that becomes instantly a debt
which he hath beforehand contracted to discharge.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Hence it is, that a judgment debtor is in legal theory liable <i><span lang="la">ex contractu</span></i>
to satisfy the judgment. “The liability of the defendant,” says Lord
Esher,<a id='r470'></a><a href='#f470' class='c016'><sup>[470]</sup></a> “arises upon the implied contract to pay the amount of the
judgment.” Similarly all pecuniary obligations of restitution are in
theory contractual, as in the case of money paid by mistake, or obtained
by fraud or duress. “If the defendant,” says Lord Mansfield,<a id='r471'></a><a href='#f471' class='c016'><sup>[471]</sup></a> “be under
an obligation, from the ties of natural justice, to refund, the law implies
a debt, and gives this action founded on the equity of the plaintiff’s case,
as it were upon a contract (<i><span lang="la">quasi ex contractu</span></i>, as the Roman law expresses
it).” So also with pecuniary obligations of indemnity; when, for example,
the goods of a stranger are distrained and sold by a landlord for rent due
by his tenant, the law implies a promise by the tenant to repay their
value to the owner thus deprived of them.<a id='r472'></a><a href='#f472' class='c016'><sup>[472]</sup></a> A similar fictitious promise
is the ground on which the law bases obligations of contribution. If, for
example, two persons acting independently of each other guarantee the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>same debt, and one of them is subsequently compelled to pay the whole,
he can recover half of the amount from the other, as due to him under a
contract implied in law, although there is clearly none in fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The second class of quasi-contracts includes all those
cases in which a person injured by a tort is allowed by the law
to waive the tort and sue in contract instead. That is to say,
there are certain obligations which are in truth delictal, and
not contractual, but which may at the option of the plaintiff
be treated as contractual, if he so pleases. Thus if one wrongfully
takes away my goods and sells them, he is guilty of the
tort known as trespass, and his obligation to pay damages
for the loss suffered by me is in reality delictal. Nevertheless
I may, if I think it to my interest, waive the tort, and
sue him on a fictitious contract, demanding from him the
payment of the money so received by him as having rightly
sold the goods as my agent, and therefore as being indebted
to me in respect of the price received by him; and he will
not be permitted to plead his own wrongdoing in bar of any
such claim.<a id='r473'></a><a href='#f473' class='c016'><sup>[473]</sup></a> So if a man obtains money from me by
fraudulent misrepresentation, I may sue him either in tort for
damages for the deceit, or on a fictitious contract for the
return of the money.</p>

<p class='c019'>The reasons which have induced the law to recognise the fiction of
quasi-contractual obligation are various. The chief of them, however,
are the three following:—</p>

<p class='c019'>(1) The traditional classification of the various forms of personal actions,
as being based either on contract or on tort. This classification could be
rendered exhaustive and sufficient only by forcing all liquidated pecuniary
obligations into the contractual class, regardless of their true nature and
origin. The theory that all common law actions are either contractual
or delictal is received by the legislature even at the present day,<a id='r474'></a><a href='#f474' class='c016'><sup>[474]</sup></a> and its
necessary corollary is the doctrine of quasi-contract.</p>

<p class='c019'>(2) The desire to supply a theoretical basis for new forms of obligation
established by judicial decision. Here as elsewhere, legal fictions are of
use in assisting the development of the law. It is easier for the courts to
say that a man is bound to pay because he must be taken to have so promised,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>than to lay down for the first time the principle that he is bound to pay
whether he has promised or not.</p>

<p class='c019'>(3) The desire of plaintiffs to obtain the benefit of the superior efficiency
of contractual remedies. In more than one respect, it was better in the
old days of formalism to sue on contract than on any other ground. The
contractual remedy of <i><span lang="la">assumpsit</span></i> was better than the action of debt, for
it did not allow to the defendant the resource of wager of law. It was
better than trespass and other delictal remedies, for it did not die with
the person of the wrongdoer, but was available against his executors.
Therefore plaintiffs were allowed to allege fictitious contracts, and to sue
on them in <i><span lang="la">assumpsit</span></i>, whereas in truth their appropriate remedy was debt
or some action <i><span lang="la">ex delicto</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c019'>It seems clear that a rational system of law is free to get rid of the
conception of quasi-contractual obligation altogether. No useful purpose
is served by it at the present day. It still remains, however, part of the
law of England, and requires recognition accordingly.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 171. <b>Innominate Obligations.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The foregoing classification of obligations as either contractual,
delictal, or quasi-contractual, is not exhaustive, for
it is based on no logical scheme of division, but proceeds by
simple enumeration only. Consequently, it is necessary to
recognise a final and residuary class which we may term
innominate, as having no comprehensive and distinctive
title.<a id='r475'></a><a href='#f475' class='c016'><sup>[475]</sup></a> Included in this class are the obligations of trustees
towards their beneficiaries, a species, indeed, which would
be sufficiently important and distinct to be classed separately
as co-ordinate with the others which have been named, were
it not for the fact that trusts are more appropriately treated
in another branch of the law, namely in that of property.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ 172. <b>Substantive Law and the Law of Procedure.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>It is no easy task to state with precision the exact nature of
the distinction between substantive law and the law of procedure,
and it will conduce to clearness if we first consider a
plausible but erroneous explanation. In view of the fact
that the administration of justice in its typical form consists
in the application of remedies to the violations of rights, it
may be suggested that substantive law is that which defines
the <em>rights</em>, while procedural law determines the <em>remedies</em>. This
application, however, of the distinction between <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> and
<i><span lang="la">remedium</span></i> is inadmissible. For in the first place there are
many rights which belong to the sphere of procedure; for
example, a right of appeal, a right to give evidence on one’s
own behalf, a right to interrogate the other party, and so on.
In the second place, rules defining the remedy may be as
much a part of the substantive law as are those which define
the right itself. No one would call the abolition of capital
punishment, for instance, a change in the law of criminal
procedure. The substantive part of the criminal law deals
not with crimes alone, but with punishments also. So in
the civil law, the rules as to the measure of damages pertain
to the substantive law, no less than those declaring what
damage is actionable; and rules determining the classes of
agreements which will be specifically enforced are as clearly
substantive as are those determining the agreements which
will be enforced at all. To define procedure as concerned
not with rights, but with remedies, is to confound the remedy
with the process by which it is made available.</p>

<p class='c007'>What, then, is the true nature of the distinction? The
law of procedure may be defined as that branch of the law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>which governs the process of litigation. It is the law of
actions—<i><span lang="la">jus quod ad actiones pertinet</span></i>—using the term action
in a wide sense to include all legal proceedings, civil or
criminal. All the residue is substantive law, and relates not
to the process of litigation, but to its purposes and subject-matter.
Substantive law is concerned with the ends which
the administration of justice seeks; procedural law deals
with the means and instruments by which those ends are
to be attained. The latter regulates the conduct and relations
of courts and litigants in respect of the litigation itself;
the former determines their conduct and relations in respect
of the matters litigated. Procedural law is concerned with
affairs inside the courts of justice; substantive law deals with
matters in the world outside.</p>

<p class='c007'>A glance at the actual contents of the law of procedure
will enable us to judge of the accuracy of this explanation.
Whether I have a right to recover certain property is a
question of substantive law, for the determination and the
protection of such rights are among the ends of the administration
of justice; but in what courts and within what time
I must institute proceedings are questions of procedural law,
for they relate merely to the modes in which the courts
fulfil their functions. What facts constitute a wrong is
determined by the substantive law; what facts constitute
proof of a wrong is a question of procedure. For the first
relates to the subject-matter of litigation, the second to the
process merely. Whether an offence is punishable by fine
or by imprisonment is a question of substantive law, for the
existence and measure of criminal liability are matters pertaining
to the end and purpose of the administration of
justice. But whether an offence is punishable summarily or
only on indictment is a question of procedure. Finally it
may be observed that, whereas the abolition of capital
punishment would be an alteration of the substantive law,
the abolition of imprisonment for debt was merely an alteration
in the law of procedure. For punishment is one of the
ends of the administration of justice, while imprisonment for
debt was merely an instrument for enforcing payment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>So far as the administration of justice is concerned with
the application of remedies to violated rights, we may say
that the substantive law defines the remedy and the right,
while the law of procedure defines the modes and conditions
of the application of the one to the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the distinction between substantive law and
procedure is sharply drawn in theory, there are many rules
of procedure which in their practical operation are wholly or
substantially equivalent to rules of substantive law. In such
cases the difference between these two branches of the law is
one of form rather than of substance. A rule belonging to
one department may by a change of form pass over into the
other without materially affecting the practical issue. In
legal history such transitions are frequent, and in legal theory
they are not without interest and importance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of these equivalent procedural and substantive principles
there are at least three classes sufficiently important to call
for notice here.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. An exclusive evidential fact is practically equivalent to
a constituent element in the title of the right to be proved.
The rule of evidence that a contract can be proved only by
a writing corresponds to a rule of substantive law that a
contract is void unless reduced to writing. In the former
case the writing is the exclusive evidence of title; in the
latter case it is part of the title itself. In the former case
the right exists but is imperfect, failing in its remedy through
defect of proof. In the latter case it fails to come into
existence at all. But for most purposes this distinction is
one of form rather than of substance.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. A conclusive evidential fact is equivalent to, and tends
to take the place of, the fact proved by it. All conclusive
presumptions pertain in form to procedure, but in effect to
the substantive law. That a child under the age of seven
years is incapable of criminal intention is a rule of evidence,
but differs only in form from the substantive rule that no
child under that age is punishable for a crime. That the
acts of a servant done about his master’s business are done
with his master’s authority is a conclusive presumption of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>law, and pertains to procedure; but it is the forerunner and
equivalent of our modern substantive law of employer’s
liability. A bond (that is to say, an admission of indebtedness
under seal) was originally operative as being conclusive
proof of the existence of the debt so acknowledged; but it is
now itself creative of a debt; for it has passed from the
domain of procedure into that of substantive law.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The limitation of actions is the procedural equivalent
of the prescription of rights. The former is the operation of
time in severing the bond between right and remedy; the
latter is the operation of time in destroying the right. The
former leaves an imperfect right subsisting; the latter leaves
no right at all. But save in this respect their practical
effect is the same, although their form is different.</p>

<p class='c006'>The normal elements of judicial procedure are five in
number, namely Summons, Pleading, Proof, Judgment, and
Execution. The object of the first is to secure for all parties
interested an opportunity of presenting themselves before the
court and making their case heard. Pleading formulates
for the use of the court and of the parties those questions
of fact or law which are in issue. Proof is the process by
which the parties supply the court with the <i><span lang="la">data</span></i> necessary
for the decision of those questions. Judgment is this decision
itself, while execution, the last step in the proceeding, is
the use of physical force in the maintenance of the judgment,
when voluntary submission is withheld. Of these five
elements of judicial procedure one only, namely proof, is of
sufficient theoretical interest to repay such abstract consideration
as is here in place. The residue of this chapter,
therefore, will be devoted to an analysis of the essential
nature of the law of evidence.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 173. <b>Evidence.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>One fact is evidence of another when it tends in any degree
to render the existence of that other probable. The quality
by virtue of which it has such an effect may be called its
<em>probative force</em>, and evidence may therefore be defined as any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>fact which possesses such force. Probative force may be of
any degree of intensity. When it is great enough to form a
rational basis for the inference that the fact so evidenced
really exists, the evidence possessing it is said to constitute
<em>proof</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is convenient to be able to distinguish shortly between
the fact which is evidence, and the fact of which it is evidence.
The former may be termed the <em>evidential fact</em>, the latter the
<em>principal fact</em>. Where, as is often the case, there is a chain of
evidence, A. being evidence of B., B. of C., C. of D. and so on,
each intermediate fact is evidential in respect of all that follow
it and principal in respect of all that precede it.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Evidence is of various kinds, being in the first place
either <em>judicial</em> or <em>extrajudicial</em>. Judicial evidence is that
which is produced to the court; it comprises all evidential
facts that are actually brought to the personal knowledge and
observation of the tribunals. Extrajudicial evidence is that
which does not come directly under judicial cognizance, but
nevertheless constitutes an intermediate link between judicial
evidence and the fact requiring proof. Judicial evidence includes
all testimony given by witnesses in court, all documents
produced to and read by the court, and all things personally
examined by the court for the purposes of proof.
Extrajudicial evidence includes all evidential facts which are
known to the court only by way of inference from some form
of judicial evidence. Testimony is extrajudicial, when it is
judicially known only through the relation of a witness who
heard it. A confession of guilt, for example, is judicial evidence
if made to the court itself, but extrajudicial if made
elsewhere and proved to the court by some form of judicial
evidence. Similarly a document is judicial evidence if produced,
extrajudicial if known to the court only through a
copy, or through the report of a witness who has read it. So
the <i><span lang="la">locus in quo</span></i> or the material subject-matter of a suit
becomes judicial evidence, when personally viewed by the
court, but is extrajudicial when described by witnesses.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is plain that in every process of proof some form of
judicial evidence is an essential element. Extrajudicial evidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>may or may not exist. When it is present, it forms an
intermediate link or a series of intermediate links in a chain
of proof, the terminal links of which are the principal fact at
one end and the judicial evidence at the other. Judicial evidence
requires production merely; extrajudicial evidence
stands itself in need of proof.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. In the second place evidence is either <em>personal</em> or <em>real</em>.
Personal evidence is otherwise termed <em>testimony</em>. It includes
all kinds of statements regarded as possessed of probative
force in respect of the facts stated. This is by far the
most important form of evidence. There are few processes
of proof that do not contain it—few facts that are capable of
being proved in courts of justice otherwise than by the testimony
of those who know them. Testimony is either oral or
written, and either judicial or extrajudicial. There is a
tendency to restrict the term to the judicial variety, but there
is no good reason for this limitation. It is better to include
under the head of testimony or personal evidence all statements,
verbal or written, judicial or extrajudicial, so far as
they are possessed of probative force. Real evidence, on
the other hand, includes all the residue of evidential facts.
Anything which is believed for any other reason than that
some one has said so, is believed on real evidence. This, too,
is either judicial or extrajudicial, though here also there is a
tendency to restrict the term to the former use.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Evidence is either <em>primary</em> or <em>secondary</em>. Other things
being equal, the longer any chain of evidence the less its
probative force, for with each successive inference the risk
of error grows. In the interests of truth, therefore, it is expedient
to shorten the process, to cut out as many as possible
of the intermediate links of extrajudicial evidence, and to
make evidence assume the judicial form at the earliest
practicable point. Hence the importance of the distinction
between primary and secondary evidence. Primary evidence
is evidence viewed in comparison with any available and less
immediate instrument of proof. Secondary evidence is that
which is compared with any available and more immediate
instrument of proof. Primary evidence of the contents of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>written document is the production in court of the document
itself; secondary evidence is the production of a copy or of
oral testimony as to the contents of the original. Primary
evidence that A. assaulted B. is the judicial testimony of C.
that he saw the assault; secondary evidence is the judicial
testimony of D. that C. told him that he saw the assault.
That secondary evidence should not be used when primary
evidence is available is, in its general form, a mere counsel of
prudence; but in particular cases, the most important of
which are those just used as illustrations, this counsel has
hardened into an obligatory rule of law. Subject to certain
exceptions, the courts will receive no evidence of a written
document save the document itself, and will listen to no hearsay
testimony.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Evidence is either <em>direct</em> or <em>circumstantial</em>. This is a distinction
important in popular opinion rather than in legal
theory. Direct evidence is testimony relating immediately
to the principal fact. All other evidence is circumstantial.
In the former case the only inference required is one from
testimony to the truth of it. In the latter the inference is of
a different nature, and is generally not single but composed
of successive steps. The testimony of A. that he saw B. commit
the offence charged, or the confession of B. that he is
guilty, constitutes direct evidence. If we believe the truth
of the testimony or confession, the matter is concluded, and
no further process of proof or inference is required. On the
other hand, the testimony of A. that B. was seen by him
leaving the place where the offence was committed, and
having the instrument of the offence in his possession, is
merely circumstantial evidence; for even if we believe this
testimony, it does not follow without a further inference, and
therefore a further risk of error, that B. is guilty. Direct
evidence is commonly considered to excel the other in probative
force. This, however, is not necessarily the case, for
witnesses lie, and facts do not. Circumstantial evidence of
innocence may well prevail over direct evidence of guilt; and
circumstantial evidence of guilt may be indefinitely stronger
than direct evidence of innocence.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ 174. <b>The Valuation of Evidence.</b></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The law of evidence comprises two parts. The first of
these consists of rules for the measurement or determination
of the <em>probative force</em> of evidence. The second consists of
rules determining the modes and conditions of the <em>production</em>
of evidence. The first deals with the effect of evidence when
produced, the second with the manner in which it is to be produced.
The first is concerned with evidence in all its forms,
whether judicial or extrajudicial; the second is concerned
with judicial evidence alone. The two departments are intimately
connected, for it is impossible to formulate rules for
the production of evidence without reference and relation to
the effect of it when produced. Nevertheless the two are distinct
in theory, and for the most part distinguishable in
practice. We shall deal with them in their order.</p>

<p class='c007'>In judicial proceedings, as elsewhere, the accurate measurement
of the evidential value of facts is a condition of the
discovery of truth. Except in the administration of justice,
however, this task is left to common sense and personal
discretion. Rules and maxims, when recognised at all, are
recognised as proper for the <em>guidance</em> of individual judgment,
not for the <em>exclusion</em> of it. But in this, as in every other
part of judicial procedure, law has been generated, and, in so
far as it extends, has made the estimation of probative force
or the weighing of evidence a matter of inflexible rules excluding
judicial discretion. These rules constitute the first
and most characteristic portion of the law of evidence. They
may be conveniently divided into five classes, declaring
respectively that certain facts amount to:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Conclusive proof—in other words, raise a conclusive
presumption;</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Presumptive proof—in other words, raise a conditional
or rebuttable presumption;</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Insufficient evidence—that is to say, do not amount
to proof, and raise no presumption, conclusive or conditional;</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Exclusive evidence—that is to say, are the only facts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>which in respect of the matter in issue possess any probative
force at all;</p>

<p class='c007'>5. No evidence—that is to say, are destitute of evidential
value.</p>

<p class='c007'>I. <em>Conclusive presumptions.</em>—By conclusive proof is meant
a fact possessing probative force of such strength as not to
admit of effective contradiction. In other words, this fact
amounts to proof irrespective of the existence or non-existence
of any other facts whatsoever which may possess probative
force in the contrary direction. By a conclusive presumption
is meant the acceptance or recognition of a fact by the
law as conclusive proof.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presumptive or conditional proof, on the other hand, is a
fact which amounts to proof, only so long as there exists no
other fact amounting to disproof. It is a provisional proof,
valid until overthrown by contrary proof. A conditional or
rebuttable presumption is the acceptance of a fact by the
law as conditional proof.<a id='r476'></a><a href='#f476' class='c016'><sup>[476]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most singular features in early systems of
procedure is the extent to which the process of proof is
dominated by conclusive presumptions. The chief part of
the early law of evidence consists of rules determining the
species of proof which is necessary and sufficient in different
cases, and allotting the benefit or burden of such proof
between the parties. He who would establish his case must
maintain it, for example, by success in that judicial battle
the issue of which was held to be the judgment of Heaven
(<i><span lang="la">judicium Dei</span></i>); or he must go unscathed through the ordeal,
and so make manifest his truth or innocence; or he must
procure twelve men to swear in set form that they believe his
testimony to be true; or it may be sufficient if he himself
makes solemn oath that his cause is just. If he succeeds
in performing the conditions so laid upon him, he will have
judgment; if he fails even in the slightest point, he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>defeated. His task is to satisfy the requirements of the law,
not to convince the court of the truth of his case. What
the court thinks of the matter is nothing to the point. The
whole procedure seems designed to take away from the
tribunals the responsibility of investigating the truth, and to
cast this burden upon providence or fate. Only gradually
and reluctantly did our law attain to the conclusion that
there is no such royal road in the administration of justice,
that the heavens are silent, that the battle goes to the strong,
that oaths are naught, and that there is no just substitute
for the laborious investigation of the truth of things at the
mouths of parties and witnesses.</p>

<p class='c007'>The days are long since past in which conclusive presumptions
played any great part in the administration of justice.
They have not, however, altogether lost their early importance.
They are, indeed, almost necessarily more or less false,
for it is seldom possible in the subject-matter of judicial
procedure to lay down with truth a general principle that any
one thing is conclusive proof of the existence of any other.
Nevertheless such principles may be just and useful even
though not wholly true. We have already seen how they
are often merely the procedural equivalents of substantive
rules which may have independent validity. They have also
been of use in developing and modifying by way of legal
fictions the narrow and perverted principles of the early law.
As an illustration of their employment in modern law we may
cite the maxim <i><span lang="la">Res judicata pro veritate accipitur</span></i>. A judgment
is conclusive evidence as between the parties, and sometimes
as against all the world, of the matters adjudicated
upon. The courts of justice may make mistakes, but no one
will be heard to say so. For their function is to terminate
disputes, and their decisions must be accepted as final and
beyond question.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. <em>Conditional presumptions.</em>—The second class of rules
for the determination of probative force are those which
establish rebuttable presumptions. For example, a person
shown not to have been heard of for seven years by those who
would naturally have heard of him if he had been alive, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>presumed to be dead. So also a negotiable instrument is
presumed to have been given for value. So also a person
accused of any offence is presumed to be innocent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of these presumptions are based on no real estimate
of probabilities, but are established for the purpose of placing
the burden of proof upon the party who is best able to bear
it, or who may most justly be made to bear it. Persons
accused of crime are probably guilty, but the presumption of
their innocence is in most cases and with certain limitations
clearly expedient.</p>

<p class='c007'>III. <em>Insufficient evidence.</em>—In the third place the law contains
rules declaring that certain evidence is insufficient, that
its probative force falls short of that required for proof, and
that it is therefore not permissible for the courts to act upon
it. An example is the rule that in certain kinds of treason
the testimony of one witness is insufficient—almost the sole
recognition by English law of the general principle, familiar
in legal history, that two witnesses are necessary for proof.</p>

<p class='c007'>IV. <em>Exclusive evidence.</em>—In the fourth place there is an
important class of rules declaring certain facts to be exclusive
evidence, none other being admissible. The execution of a
document which requires attestation can be proved in no
other way than by the testimony of an attesting witness, unless
owing to death or some other circumstance his testimony
is unavailable. A written contract can be proved in no other
way than by the production of the writing itself, whenever
its production is possible. Certain kinds of contracts, such as
one for the sale of land, cannot be proved except by writing,
no verbal testimony being of virtue enough in the law to
establish the existence of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is only in respect of very special kinds of contracts that
written evidence can wisely be demanded by the law. In
the case of all ordinary mercantile agreements such a requirement
does more harm than good; and the law would do
well in accepting the principle that a man’s word is as good
as his bond. The Statute of Frauds, by which most of these
rules of exclusive evidence have been established, is an
instrument for the encouragement of frauds rather than for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>the suppression of them. How much longer is it to remain
in force as a potent instrument for the perversion of English
law? Its repeal would sweep away at one stroke the
immense accumulation of irrational technicality and complexity
that has grown in the course of centuries from this
evil root.</p>

<p class='c007'>V. <em>Facts which are not evidence.</em>—Fifthly and lastly there
are rules declaring that certain facts are not evidence, that is
to say, are destitute of any probative force at all. Such facts
are not to be produced to the court, and if produced no weight
is to be attributed to them, for no accumulation of them can
amount to proof. For example, hearsay is no evidence, the
bond of connexion between it and the principal fact so
reported at second hand being in the eye of the law too
slight for any reliance to be justly placed upon it. Similarly
the general bad character of an accused person is no evidence
that he is guilty of any particular offence charged
against him; although his good character is evidence of his
innocence.</p>

<p class='c007'>These rules of exclusion or irrelevancy assume two distinct
forms, characteristic respectively of the earlier and later
periods in the development of the law. At the present day
they are almost wholly rules for the exclusion of <em>evidence</em>; in
earlier times they were rules for the exclusion of <em>witnesses</em>.
The law imposed testimonial incapacity upon certain classes
of persons on the ground of their antecedent incredibility.
No party to a suit, no person possessing any pecuniary interest
in the event of it, no person convicted of any infamous
offence, was a competent witness. His testimony was deemed
destitute of evidential value on account of the suspicious
nature of its source. The law has now learned that it is
not in this fashion that the truth is to be sought for and
found. It has now more confidence in individual judgment
and less in general rules. It no longer condemns witnesses
unheard, but receives the testimony of all, placing the old
grounds of exclusion at their proper level as reasons for
suspicion but not for antecedent rejection. Whether rules
for the exclusion of evidence are not in general exposed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>the same objections that have already prevailed against the
roles for the exclusion of witnesses is a question which we
shall presently consider.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 175. <b>The Production of Evidence.</b></h3>

<p class='c015'>The second part of the law of evidence consists of rules
regulating its production. It deals with the process of
adducing evidence, and not with the effect of it when
adduced. It comprises every rule relating to evidence,
except those which amount to legal determinations of probative
force. It is concerned for example with the manner
in which witnesses are to be examined and cross-examined,
not with the weight to be attributed to their testimony. In
particular it includes several important rules of exclusion
based on grounds independent of any estimate of the probative
force of the evidence so excluded. Considerations of
expense, delay, vexation, and the public interest require
much evidence to be excluded which is of undoubted evidential
value. A witness may be able to testify to much that
is relevant and important in respect of the matters in issue,
and nevertheless may not be compelled or even permitted to
give such testimony. A public official, for example, cannot
be compelled to give evidence as to affairs of state, nor is a
legal adviser permitted or compellable to disclose communications
made to him by or on behalf of his client.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most curious and interesting of all these rules of
exclusion is the maxim, <i><span lang="la">Nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare</span></i>. No
man, not even the accused himself, can be compelled to
answer any question the answer to which may tend to prove
him guilty of a crime. No one can be used as the unwilling
instrument of his own conviction. He may confess, if he so
pleases, and his confession will be received against him;
but if tainted by any form of physical or moral compulsion,
it will be rejected. The favour with which this rule has
been received is probably due to the recoil of English law
from the barbarities of the old Continental system of torture
and inquisitorial process. Even as contrasted with the
modern Continental procedure, in which the examination of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>the accused seems to English eyes too prominent and too
hostile, the rule of English law is not without merits. It
confers upon a criminal trial an aspect of dignity, humanity,
and impartiality, which the contrasted inquisitorial process
is too apt to lack. Nevertheless it seems impossible to resist
Bentham’s conclusion that the rule is destitute of any
rational foundation, and that the compulsory examination
of the accused is an essential feature of sound criminal procedure.
Even its defenders admit that the English rule is
extremely favourable to the guilty, and in a proceeding the
aim of which is to convict the guilty, this would seem to be a
sufficient condemnation. The innocent have nothing to fear
from compulsory examination, and everything to gain; the
guilty have nothing to gain, and everything to fear. A
criminal trial is not to be adequately conceived as a fight
between the accused and his accuser; and there is no place in
it for maxims whose sole foundation is a supposed duty of
generous dealing with adversaries. Subject always to the
important qualification that a good <i><span lang="la">prima facie</span></i> case must
first be established by the prosecutor, every man should be
compellable to answer with his own lips the charges that are
made against him.<a id='r477'></a><a href='#f477' class='c016'><sup>[477]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A matter deserving notice in connexion with this part of
the law of evidence is the importance still attached to the
ceremony of the oath. One of the great difficulties involved
in the process of proof is that of distinguishing between true
testimony and false. By what test is the lying witness to be
detected, and by what means is corrupt testimony to be
prevented? Three methods commended themselves to the
wisdom of our ancestors. These were the judicial combat,
the ordeal, and the oath. The first two of these have long
since been abandoned as ineffective, but the third is still
retained as a characteristic feature of judicial procedure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>though we may assume with some confidence that its rejection
will come in due time, and will in no way injure the cause
of truth and justice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Trial by battle, so soon as it acquired a theory at all,
became in reality a form of ordeal. In common with the
ordeal commonly so called, it is the <i><span lang="la">judicium Dei</span></i>; it is an
appeal to the God of battles to make manifest the right by
giving the victory to him whose testimony is true. Successful
might is the divinely appointed test of right. So in the
ordeal, the party or witness whose testimony is impeached
calls upon Heaven to bear witness to his truth by saving him
harmless from the fire. The theory of the oath is generically
the same. “An oath,” says Hobbes,<a id='r478'></a><a href='#f478' class='c016'><sup>[478]</sup></a> “is a form of speech
added to a promise; by which he that promiseth, signifieth
that unless he perform, he renounceth the mercy of his God,
or calleth to him for vengeance on himself. Such was the
heathen form, Let Jupiter kill me else, as I kill this beast.
So is our form, I shall do thus and thus, so help me God.”
The definition is correct save that it is restricted to promissory,
instead of including also declaratory oaths. A man
may swear not only that he will speak the truth, but that
certain statements are the truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The idea of the oath, therefore, is that his testimony is
true who is prepared to imprecate divine vengeance on his
own head in case of falsehood. Yet it needs but little
experience of courts of justice to discover how ineffective is
any such check on false witness and how little likely is the
retention of it to increase respect either for religion or for
the administration of justice. The true preventive of false
testimony is an efficient law for its punishment as a crime.
Punishment falling swiftly and certainly upon offending
witnesses would purge the courts of an evil which the
cumbrous inefficiency of the present law of perjury has done
much to encourage, and which all the oaths in the world
will do nothing to abate.<a id='r479'></a><a href='#f479' class='c016'><sup>[479]</sup></a></p>

  <h3 class='c017'>§ 176. <b>Criticism of the Law of Evidence.</b></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>We have in a former chapter considered the advantages
and disadvantages of that substitution of predetermined
principles for judicial discretion which constitutes the
essential feature of the administration of justice according to
law. In no portion of our legal system is this question of
more immediate importance than in the law of evidence.
Here, if anywhere, the demerits of law are at a maximum,
and those of the opposing system at a minimum. General
rules for the predetermination of probative force are of
necessity more or less false. It is impossible to say with
truth and <i><span lang="la">a priori</span></i> what evidence is or is not sufficient for
proof. It is not true that hearsay is absolutely destitute of
evidential value; it is not true that a contract for the sale
of land cannot be satisfactorily proved by oral testimony;
it is not true that the contents of a document cannot be
well proved by a copy of it. To elevate these maxims and
such as these from their proper position as counsels for
warning and guidance, to the level of rigid and peremptory
rules, is to be inevitably led astray by them. Like all
general principles they are obtained by way of abstraction
and elimination of elements which may be, in particular
instances, of the first importance. To apply such abstract
principles to concrete cases without making the needful
allowance for the special circumstances of these cases is as
wise as to apply the laws of motion without allowing for the
disturbing influence of friction.</p>

<p class='c007'>No unprejudiced observer can be blind to the excessive
credit and importance attached in judicial procedure to the
<i><span lang="la">minutiae</span></i> of the law of evidence. This is one of the last
refuges of legal formalism. Nowhere is the contrast more
striking between the law’s confidence in itself and its distrust
of the judicial intelligence. The fault is to be remedied not
by the abolition of all rules for the measurement of evidential
value, but by their reduction from the position of rigid and
peremptory to that of flexible and conditional rules.<a id='r480'></a><a href='#f480' class='c016'><sup>[480]</sup></a> Most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>of them have their source in good sense and practical
experience, and they are profitable for the guidance of
individual discretion, though mischievous as substitutes
for it. The cases are few in which we can rightly place
such rules upon the higher level. In general, courts of
justice should be allowed full liberty to reject as irrelevant,
superfluous, or vexatious, whatever evidence they will, and to
accept at such valuation as they please whatever evidence
seems good to them. We must learn to think less highly
of the wisdom of the law, and less meanly of the understanding
and honour of its administrators, and we may
anticipate with confidence that in this department at least
of judicial practice the change will be in the interests of
truth and justice.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>APPENDIX I.<br> <span class='c013'>THE NAMES OF THE LAW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The purpose of the following pages is to consider, in respect of their
origin and relations, the various names and titles which have been borne
by the law in different languages. This seems an inquiry fit to be undertaken
in the hope that judicial terms may be found to throw some light
upon the juridical ideas of which they are the manifestation. A comparison
of diverse usages of speech may serve to correct misleading associations,
or to suggest relations that may be easily overlooked by any one confining
his attention to a single language.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first fact which an examination of juridical nomenclature reveals,
is that all names for law are divisible into two classes, and that almost
every language possesses one or more specimens of each. To the first
class belong such terms as <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i>, <i><span lang="de">recht</span></i>, <i><span lang="it">diritto</span></i>, <em>equity</em>. To the second
belong <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">loi</span></i>, <i><span lang="de">gesetz</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">legge</span></i>, <em>law</em>, and many others. It is a striking peculiarity
of the English language that it does not possess any <i><span lang="la">generic</span></i> term falling
within the first of these groups; for equity, in the technical juridical
sense, means only a special department of civil law, not the whole of it,
and therefore is not co-extensive with <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i>, and the other foreign terms
with which it is classed. Since, therefore, we have in English no pair of
contrasted terms adequate for the expression of the distinction between
these two groups of names, we are constrained to have recourse to a
foreign language, and we shall employ for this purpose the terms <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> and
<i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>, using each as typical of and representing all other terms which belong
to the same group as itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>What, then, are the points of difference between <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>; what is
the importance and the significance of the distinction between the two
classes of terms? In the first place <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> has an ethical as well as a juridical
application, while <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i> is purely juridical. <i><span lang="la">Jus</span></i> means not only law but
also right. <i><span lang="la">Lex</span></i> means law and not also right. Thus our own <i><span lang="la">equity</span></i> has
clearly the double meaning; it means either the rules of natural justice, or
that special department of the civil law which was developed and
administered in the Court of Chancery. The English <em>law</em>, on the other
hand, has a purely juridical application; justice in itself, and as such, has
no claim to the name of <em>law</em>. So also with <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i> as opposed to <i><span lang="la">loi</span></i>, with
<i><span lang="de">recht</span></i> as opposed to <i><span lang="de">gesetz</span></i>, with <i><span lang="it">diritto</span></i> as opposed to <i><span lang="la">legge</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>If we inquire after the cause of this duplication of terms we find it in
the double aspect of the complete juridical conception of law. Law arises
from the union of justice and force, of right and might. It is justice
recognised and established by authority. It is right realised through
power. Since, therefore, it has two sides and aspects, it may be looked
at from two different points of view, and we may expect to find, as we find
in fact, that it acquires two different names. <i><span lang="la">Jus</span></i> is law looked at from
the point of view of right and justice; <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i> is law looked at from the point
of view of authority and force. <i><span lang="la">Jus</span></i> is the rule of right which becomes
law by its authoritative establishment; <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i> is the authority by virtue of
which the rule of right becomes law. Law is <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> in respect of its <em>contents</em>,
namely the rule of right; it is <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i> in respect of its <em>source</em>, namely, its
recognition and enforcement by the state. We see, then, how it is that
so many words for law mean justice also; since justice is the content or
subject-matter of law, and from this subject-matter law derives its title.
We understand also how it is that so many words for law do not also
mean justice; law has another side and aspect from which it appears, not
as justice realised and established, but as the instrument through which
its realisation and establishment are effected.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><span lang="la">A priori</span></i> we may presume that in the case of those terms which possess
a double application, both ethical and legal, the ethical is historically
prior, and the legal later and derivative. We may assume that justice
comes to mean law, not that law comes to mean justice. This is the
logical order, and is presumably the historical order also. As a matter
of fact this presumption is, as we shall see, correct in the case of all modern
terms possessing the double signification. In the case of <i><span lang="de">recht</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i>,
<i><span lang="it">diritto</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">equity</span></i>, the ethical sense is undoubtedly primary, and the legal
secondary. In respect of the corresponding Greek and Latin terms (<i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>,
<span lang="grc">δίκαιον</span>) the data would seem insufficient for any confident conclusion.
The reverse order of development is perfectly possible; there is no reason
why lawful should not come to mean in a secondary sense rightful, though
a transition in the opposite direction is more common and more natural.
The significant fact is the union of the two meanings in the same word,
not the order of development.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second distinction between <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i> is that the former is usually
<em>abstract</em>, the second <em>concrete</em>.<a id='r481'></a><a href='#f481' class='c016'><sup>[481]</sup></a> The English term law indeed combines
both these uses in itself. In its abstract application we speak of the law
of England, criminal law, courts of law. In its concrete sense, we say
that Parliament has enacted or repealed a law. In foreign languages, on
the other hand, this union of the two significations is unusual. <i><span lang="la">Jus</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i>,
<i><span lang="de">recht</span></i> mean law in the abstract, not in the concrete. <i><span lang="la">Lex</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">loi</span></i>, <i><span lang="de">gesetz</span></i> signify,
at least primarily and normally, a legal enactment, or a rule established
by way of enactment, not law in the abstract. This, however, is not
invariably the case. <i><span lang="la">Lex</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">loi</span></i>, and some other terms belonging to the same
group have undoubtedly acquired a secondary and abstract signification
in addition to their primary and concrete one. In medieval usage the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>law of the land is <i><span lang="la">lex terrae</span></i>, and the law of England is <i><span lang="la">lex et consuetudo
Angliae</span></i>. So in modern French <i><span lang="la">loi</span></i> is often merely an equivalent for <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i>.
We cannot therefore regard the second distinction between <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>
as essential. It is closely connected with the first, but, though natural
and normal, it is not invariable. The characteristic difference between
English and foreign usage is not that our <em>law</em> combines the abstract and
concrete significations (for so also do certain Continental terms), but that
the English language contains no generic term which combines ethical
and legal meanings as do <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i>, and <i><span lang="de">recht</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>RECHT, DROIT, DIRITTO.—These three terms are all closely connected
with each other and with the English <em>right</em>. The French and
Italian words are derivatives of the Latin <i><span lang="la">directus</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">rectus</span></i>, these being
cognate with <i><span lang="de">recht</span></i> and <em>right</em>. We may with some confidence assume the
following order of development among the various ideas represented by
this group of expressions:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The original meaning was in all probability <em>physical straightness</em>.
This use is still retained in our <em>right</em> angle and <em>direct</em>. The root is RAG, to
stretch or straighten. The group of connected terms ruler, <i><span lang="la">rex</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">rajah</span></i>,
regulate, and others, would seem to be independently derived from the
same root, but not to be in the same line of development as right and its
synonyms. The ruler or regulator is he who keeps things straight or
keeps order, not he who establishes the right. Nor is the right that which
is established by a ruler.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. In a second and derivative sense the terms are used metaphorically
to indicate moral approval—ethical rightness, not physical. Moral disapproval
is similarly expressed by the metaphorical expressions wrong
and tort, that is to say, crooked or twisted. These are metaphors that
still commend themselves; for the honest man is still the straight and
upright man, and the ways of wickedness are still crooked. In this sense,
therefore, <i><span lang="de">recht</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i>, and <i><span lang="it">diritto</span></i> signify justice and right.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The first application being physical and the second ethical, the third
is juridical. The transition from the second to the third is easy. Law
is justice as recognised and protected by the state. The rules of law are
the rules of right, as authoritatively established and enforced by tribunals
appointed to that end. What more natural, therefore, than for the
ethical terms to acquire derivatively a juridical application? At this
point, however, our modern English <em>right</em> has parted company with its
Continental relatives. It has remained physical and ethical, being
excluded from the juridical sphere by the superior convenience of the
English <em>law</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. The fourth and last use of the terms we are considering may be
regarded as derivative of both the second and third. It is that in which
we speak of <em>rights</em>, namely, claims, powers, or other advantages conferred
or recognised by the rule of right or the rule of law. That a debtor should
pay his debt to his creditor is not merely right, it is <em>the</em> right of the
creditor. Right is <em>his</em> right for whose benefit it exists. So, also, wrong
is <em>the</em> wrong of him who is injured by it. The Germans distinguish this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>use of the term by the expression <i><span lang="la">subjectives Recht</span></i> (right as vested in a
subject) as opposed to <i><span lang="la">objectives Recht</span></i>, namely, the rule of justice or of
law as it exists objectively. The English <em>right</em> has been extended to
cover legal as well as ethical <em>claims</em>, though it has, as we have seen, been
confined to ethical <em>rules</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>A.S. RIHT.—It is worthy of notice that the Anglo-Saxon <i><span lang="la">riht</span></i>, the
progenitor of our modern <em>right</em>, possessed like its Continental relatives the
legal in addition to the ethical meaning. The common law is <i><span lang="la">folc-riht</span></i>.<a id='r482'></a><a href='#f482' class='c016'><sup>[482]</sup></a>
The divine law is <i><span lang="la">godes riht</span></i>.<a id='r483'></a><a href='#f483' class='c016'><sup>[483]</sup></a> A plaintiff claims property as “his by
<i><span lang="la">folc-riht</span></i>,”<a id='r484'></a><a href='#f484' class='c016'><sup>[484]</sup></a> even as a Roman would have claimed it as being <i><span lang="la">dominus ex
jure Quiritium</span></i>. The usage, however, did not prosper. It had to face the
formidable and ultimately successful rivalry of the English (originally
Danish) <em>law</em>, and even Norman-French, on its introduction into England,
fell under the same influence. For a time, indeed, in the earlier books
we find both <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">ley</span></i> as competing synonyms,<a id='r485'></a><a href='#f485' class='c016'><sup>[485]</sup></a> but the issue was
never doubtful. The archaism of “common right” as a synonym for
“common law” is the sole relic left in England of a usage universal in
Continental languages.</p>

<p class='c007'>EQUITY.—The English term equity has pursued the same course of
development as the German <i><span lang="de">recht</span></i> and the French <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Its primitive meaning, if we trace the word back to its Latin source,
<i><span lang="la">aequum</span></i>, is physical equality or evenness, just as physical straightness is
the earliest meaning of right and its analogues.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Its secondary sense is ethical. Just as rightness is straightness, so
equity is equality. In each case there is an easy and obvious metaphorical
transition from the physical to the moral idea. Equity therefore is
justice.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. In a third and later stage of its development the word takes on a
juridical significance. It comes to mean a particular portion of the civil
law—that part, namely, which was developed by and administered in
the Court of Chancery. Like <i><span lang="de">recht</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i> it passed from the sense of
justice in itself to that of the rules in accordance with which justice is
administered.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Fourthly and lastly we have to notice a legal and technical use of
the term equity, as meaning any claim or advantage recognised or conferred
by a rule of equity, just as a right signifies any claim or advantage
derived from a rule of right. An equity is an equitable, as opposed to
a legal right. “When the equities are equal,” so runs the maxim of
Chancery, “the law prevails.” So a debt is assignable “subject to
equities.”</p>

<p class='c007'>JUS.—We have to distinguish in the case of <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> the same three uses
that have already been noticed in the case of <i><span lang="de">recht</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i>, and equity.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>1. Right or Justice. “<i><span lang="la">Id quod semper aequum ac bonum est jus dicitur</span></i>,”
says Paulus.<a id='r486'></a><a href='#f486' class='c016'><sup>[486]</sup></a> From <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> in this sense are derived <i><span lang="la">justitia</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">justum</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Law. This is the most usual application of the term, the juridical
sense having a much greater predominance over the ethical in the case of
<i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>, than in that of its modern representatives <i><span lang="de">recht</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i>. <i><span lang="la">Jus</span></i>, in
its ethical signification, is distinguished as <i><span lang="la">jus naturale</span></i>, and in its legal
sense as <i><span lang="la">jus civile</span></i>. It is often contrasted with <i><span lang="la">fas</span></i>, the one being human
and the other divine law. <i><span lang="la">Jus</span></i>, however, is also used in a wider sense to
include both of these—<i><span lang="la">jus divinum et humanum</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. A right, moral or legal: <i><span lang="la">jus suum cuique tribuere</span></i>.<a id='r487'></a><a href='#f487' class='c016'><sup>[487]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The origin and primary signification of <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> are uncertain. It is generally
agreed, however, that the old derivation from <i><span lang="la">jussum</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">jubere</span></i> is not
merely incorrect, but an actual reversal of the true order of terms and
ideas. <i><span lang="la">Jussum</span></i> is a derivative of <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>. <i><span lang="la">Jubere</span></i> is, in its proper and original
sense, to declare, hold, or establish anything as <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>. It was the recognised
expression for the legislative action of the Roman people. <i><span lang="la">Legem jubere</span></i>
is to give to a statute (<i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>) the force of law (<i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>). Only in a secondary
and derivative sense is <i><span lang="la">jubere</span></i> equivalent to <i><span lang="la">imperare</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most probable opinion is that <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> is derived from the Aryan root
YU, to join together (a root which appears also in <i><span lang="la">jugem</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">jungo</span></i>, and in
the English <i><span lang="la">yoke</span></i>). It has been suggested accordingly that <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> in its
original sense means that which is fitting, applicable, or suitable. If this
is so, there is a striking correspondence between the history of the Latin
term and that of the modern words already considered by us, the primary
sense in all cases being physical, the ethical sense being a metaphorical
derivative of this, and the legal application coming last. The transition
from the physical to the ethical sense in the case of the English <em>fit</em> and
<em>fitting</em> is instructive in this connexion. Another suggestion, however, is
that <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> means primarily that which is <em>binding</em>—the bond of moral and
subsequently of legal obligation. But no definite conclusion on this
matter is possible.<a id='r488'></a><a href='#f488' class='c016'><sup>[488]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="grc">Δίκη. τό δίκαιον.</span>—The Greek term which most nearly corresponds to
the Latin <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> is <span lang="grc">δίκη</span>. These words cannot, however, be regarded as
synonymous. The juridical use of <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> is much more direct and predominant
than the corresponding use of <span lang="grc">δίκη</span>. Indeed, we may say of
the Greek term that it possesses juridical implications, rather than applications.
Its chief uses are the following, the connexion between them being
obvious: (1) custom, usage, way; (2) right, justice; (3) law, or at least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>legal right; (4) judgment; (5) a lawsuit; (6) a penalty; (7) a court of
law. The primary sense is said to be that first mentioned, viz. custom.
The transition is easy from the idea of the customary to that of the right,
and from the idea of the right to that of the lawful. In the case of the
Latin <i><span lang="la">mos</span></i> we may trace an imperfect and tentative development in the
same direction.<a id='r489'></a><a href='#f489' class='c016'><sup>[489]</sup></a> Professor Clark, on the other hand, prefers to regard
judgment as the earliest meaning of <span lang="grc">δίκη</span>, the other ethical and legal
applications being derivatives from this, and <span lang="grc">δίκη</span> in the sense of custom
being an independent formation from the original root.<a id='r490'></a><a href='#f490' class='c016'><sup>[490]</sup></a> Such an order
of development seems difficult and unnatural. Analogy and the connexion
of ideas seem to render more probable the order previously
suggested, viz. custom, right, law, and finally the remaining legal uses.<a id='r491'></a><a href='#f491' class='c016'><sup>[491]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="grc">Θέμις Θέμιστες.</span>—As <span lang="grc">δίκη</span> corresponds to <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>, so <span lang="grc">θέμις</span> apparently
corresponds to <i><span lang="la">fas</span></i>. While <i><span lang="la">fas</span></i>, however, preserved its original signification
as that which is right by divine ordinance, and never acquired any
secondary legal applications or implications, the Greek term proved more
flexible, and consequently has to be reckoned with in the present connection.
The matter is one of very considerable difficulty, and no certain
conclusions seem possible, but the following order of development would
seem to commend itself as the most probable:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <span lang="grc">Θέμις</span>, divine ordinance, the will of the gods. The term is derived
from the Aryan root DHA, to set, place, appoint, or establish, which
appears also in <span lang="grc">θεσμός</span>, a statute or ordinance.<a id='r492'></a><a href='#f492' class='c016'><sup>[492]</sup></a> This latter term, however,
included <em>human</em> enactments, while <span lang="grc">θέμις</span> was never so used. The
Greek term is cognate with <i><span lang="la">thesis</span></i> and <em>theme</em>, and with our English <em>doom</em>,
a word whose early legal uses we shall consider later.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <span lang="grc">Θέμις</span>, right. The transition is easy from that which is decreed and
willed by the gods, to that which it is right for mortal men to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <span lang="grc">Θέμιστες</span>, the rules of right, whether moral or legal, so far as any such
distinction was recognised in that early stage of thought to which these
linguistic usages belong.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <span lang="grc">Θέμιστες</span>, judgments, judicial declarations of the rules of right and

<p class='c007'>LEX.—So far we have dealt solely with those words which belong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>to the class of <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>, namely, those which possess a double signification,
ethical and legal. We proceed now to the consideration of the second
class, represented by <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>. And first of <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i> itself. The following are its
various uses given in what is probably the historical order of their
establishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Proposals, terms, conditions, offers made by one party and accepted
by another.<a id='r494'></a><a href='#f494' class='c016'><sup>[494]</sup></a> Thus, <i><span lang="la">ea lege ut</span></i>,<a id='r495'></a><a href='#f495' class='c016'><sup>[495]</sup></a> on condition that; <i><span lang="la">dicta tibi est lex</span></i>,<a href='#f495' class='c016'><sup>[495]</sup></a> you
know the conditions; <i><span lang="la">his legibus</span></i>,<a href='#f495' class='c016'><sup>[495]</sup></a> on these conditions. So <i><span lang="la">legis pacis</span></i><a href='#f495' class='c016'><sup>[495]</sup></a> are
the terms and conditions of peace: <i><span lang="la">pax data Philippo in has leges est</span></i>.<a href='#f495' class='c016'><sup>[495]</sup></a>
Similarly in law, <i><span lang="la">leges locationis</span></i> are the terms and conditions agreed upon
between lender and borrower. So we have the legal expressions <i><span lang="la">lex
mancipii</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">lex commissoria</span></i>, and others.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. A statute enacted by the <i><span lang="la">populus Romanus</span></i> in the <i><span lang="la">comitia centuriata</span></i>
on the proposal of a magistrate. This would seem to be a specialised
application of <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i> in the first-mentioned sense. Such a statute is conceived
rather as an agreement than as a command. It is a proposal made by
the consuls and accepted by the Roman people. It is therefore <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>, even
as a proposal of peace made and accepted between the victor and the
vanquished is <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>. “<i><span lang="la">Lex</span></i>,” says Justinian, “<i><span lang="la">est quod populus Romanus
senatorio magistratu interrogante, veluti consule, constituebat</span></i>.”<a id='r496'></a><a href='#f496' class='c016'><sup>[496]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>3. Any statute howsoever made—whether by way of authoritative
imposition, or by way of agreement with a self-governing people.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Any rule of action imposed or observed, e.g. <i><span lang="la">lex loquendi</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">lex sermonis</span></i>.
This is simply an analogical extension similar to that which is familiar in
respect of the corresponding terms in modern languages, <em>law</em>, <i><span lang="la">loi</span></i>, <i><span lang="de">gesetz</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Law in the abstract sense. <i><span lang="la">Lex</span></i>, so used, cannot be regarded as
classical Latin, although in certain instances, as in Cicero’s references to
<i><span lang="la">lex naturae</span></i>, we find what seems a very close approximation to it. In
medieval Latin, however, the abstract signification is quite common, as
in the phrases <i><span lang="la">lex Romana</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">lex terrae</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">lex communis</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">lex et consuetudo</span></i>.<a id='r497'></a><a href='#f497' class='c016'><sup>[497]</sup></a> <i><span lang="la">Lex</span></i>
has become equivalent to jus in its legal applications. This use is still
retained in certain technical expressions of private international law, such
as <i><span lang="la">lex fori</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">lex domicilii</span></i>, and others.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is possible that we have here an explanation of the very curious fact
that so celebrated and important a word as <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> failed to maintain itself in
the Romance languages. Of the two terms <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>, bequeathed to
later times by the Latin language, one was accepted (<i><span lang="la">loi</span></i> = <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>) and the
other rejected and supplanted by a modern substitute (<i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i>, <i><span lang="it">diritto</span></i>).
Why was this? May it not have been owing to that post-classical use of
<i><span lang="la">lex</span></i> in the abstract sense, whereby it became synonymous and co-extensive
with <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>? If <i><span lang="la">lex Romana</span></i> was <i><span lang="la">jus civile</span></i>, why should the growing languages
of modern Europe cumber themselves with both terms? The survivor
of the two rivals was <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>. At a later stage the natural evolution of thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>and speech conferred juridical uses on the ethical terms <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">diritto</span></i>
and the ancient duality of legal nomenclature was restored.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Judgment. This, like the last and like the three following uses, is
a medieval addition to the meanings of <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>. We have already seen the
transition from law to judgment in the case of <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>, <span lang="grc">δίκη</span>, and <span lang="grc">θέμις</span>.
<i><span lang="la">Legem facere</span></i> is to obey or fulfil the requirements of a judgment. <i><span lang="la">Legem
vadiare</span></i>, the English wager of law, is to give security for such obedience
and fulfilment.<a id='r498'></a><a href='#f498' class='c016'><sup>[498]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>7. The penalty, proof, or other matter imposed or required by a judgment:
<i><span lang="la">lex ignea</span></i>, the ordeal of fire; <i><span lang="la">lex duelli</span></i>, trial by battle.<a id='r499'></a><a href='#f499' class='c016'><sup>[499]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>8. Legal rights, regarded collectively as constituting a man’s legal
standing or status. <i><span lang="la">Legem amittere</span></i> (in English, to lose one’s law) was in
early English law an event analogous to the <i><span lang="la">capitis deminutio</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">infamia</span></i>
of the Romans. It was a loss of legal status, a partial deprivation of legal
rights and capacities.<a id='r500'></a><a href='#f500' class='c016'><sup>[500]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="grc">Νόμος.</span>—As <span lang="grc">δίκη</span> corresponds to <i><span lang="la">jus</span></i> and <span lang="grc">θέμις</span> to <i><span lang="la">fas</span></i>, so <span lang="grc">νόμος</span> is the
Greek equivalent of <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>. We have to distinguish two uses of the term,
one earlier and general, the other later and specialised.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <span lang="grc">Νόμος</span> is used in a very wide sense to include any human institution,
anything established or received among men, whether by way of custom,
opinion, convention, law or otherwise. It was contrasted, at least in the
language of the philosophers, with <span lang="grc">φύσις</span>, or nature. That which is
natural is <span lang="grc">το φυσικόν</span>; that which is artificial, owing its origin to the
art and invention of mankind, is <span lang="grc">τὸ νομικόν</span>. It is often said that the
earliest meaning of <span lang="grc">νόμος</span> is custom. The original conception, however,
seems to include not merely that which is established by long usage, but
that which is established, received, ordained, or appointed in whatever
fashion. <span lang="grc">Νόμος</span> is <i><span lang="la">institutum</span></i>, rather than <i><span lang="la">consuetudo</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="grc">Νόμος</span> in a later, secondary, and specialised application, means a statute,
ordinance, or law. So prominent among human institutions are the laws
by which men are governed, so greatly with increasing political development
do the spheres and influence of legislation extend themselves, that
the <span lang="grc">νόμοι</span> became in a special and pre-eminent sense the laws of the state.
<span lang="grc">Νόμος</span> was a word unknown to Homer, but it became in later times the
leading juridical term of the Greek language. The Greeks spoke and
wrote of the laws (<span lang="grc">νόμοι</span>), while the Romans, perhaps with a truer legal
insight, concerned themselves with the law (<i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>). When, like Cicero, they
write <i><span lang="la">de legibus</span></i>, it is in imitation of Greek usage.</p>

<p class='c007'>LAW.—Law is by no means the earliest legal term acquired by the
English language. Curiously enough, indeed, it would seem not even to
be indigenous, but to be one of those additions to Anglo-Saxon speech
which are due to the Danish invasions and settlements. Of the earlier
terms the commonest, and the most significant for our present purpose, is
<i><span lang="la">dom</span></i>, the ancestor of our modern <em>doom</em>.<a id='r501'></a><a href='#f501' class='c016'><sup>[501]</sup></a> A <em>dom</em> or <em>doom</em> is either (1) a law,
ordinance, or statute, or (2) a judgment. It does not seem possible to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>attribute with any confidence historical priority to either of these senses.
In modern English the idea of judgment has completely prevailed over
and excluded that of ordinance, but we find no such predominance of
either meaning in Anglo-Saxon usage. The word has its source in the
Aryan root DHA, to place, set, establish, appoint, and it is therefore
equally applicable to the decree of the judge and to that of the lawgiver.
In the laws of King Alfred we find the term in both its senses. “These
are the dooms which Almighty God himself spake unto Moses and commanded
him to keep.”<a id='r502'></a><a href='#f502' class='c016'><sup>[502]</sup></a> “Judge then not one doom to the rich and
another to the poor.”<a id='r503'></a><a href='#f503' class='c016'><sup>[503]</sup></a> In the following passage of the laws of Edgar
the laws of the Danes are plainly equivalent to the dooms of the English:
“I will that secular right stand among the Danes with as good laws as
they best may choose. But with the English let that stand which I and
my Witan have added to the dooms of my forefathers.”<a id='r504'></a><a href='#f504' class='c016'><sup>[504]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Doom is plainly cognate to <span lang="grc">θέμις</span>. The religious implication, however,
which, in the Greek term, is general and essential, is, in the English term,
special and accidental. In modern English doom is, like <span lang="grc">θέμις</span>, the will,
decree and judgment of Heaven—fate or destiny; but the Anglo-Saxon
<i><span lang="la">dom</span></i> included the ordinances and judgments of mortal men, no less than
those of the gods. <span lang="grc">Θέμις</span>, therefore, acquired the sense of human law
only derivatively through the sense of right, and so belongs to the class of
<i><span lang="la">jus</span></i>, not of <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>; while doom, like <span lang="grc">θεσμός</span>, acquired juridical applications
directly, and so stands besides lex and <span lang="grc">νόμος</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><span lang="la">Dom</span></i>, together with all the other Anglo-Saxon legal terms, including,
strangely enough, <em>right</em> itself, was rapidly superseded by <i><span lang="la">lagu</span></i>, which is
the modern <em>law</em>. The new term makes its appearance in the tenth century,
and the passage cited above from the laws of King Edgar is one of the
earliest instances of its use. <i><span lang="la">Lagu</span></i> and law are derived from the root
LAGH, to lay, settle, or place. Law is that which is laid down. There
is a considerable conflict of opinion as to whether it is identical in origin
with the Latin <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i> (<i><span lang="la">leg-</span></i>). Schmidt and others decide in the affirmative,<a id='r505'></a><a href='#f505' class='c016'><sup>[505]</sup></a>
and the probabilities of the case seem to favour this opinion. The resemblance
between law and <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i> seems too close to be accidental. If this is
so, the origin of <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i> is to be found in the Latin <i><span lang="la">lego</span></i>, not in its later sense
of reading, but in its original sense of laying down or setting (as in the
derivative <i><span lang="la">lectus</span></i>), which is also the primary signification of the Greek
<span lang="grc">λέγῳ</span>, the German <i><span lang="la">legen</span></i>, and the English <i><span lang="la">lay</span></i>.<a id='r506'></a><a href='#f506' class='c016'><sup>[506]</sup></a> If this is so, then law and
<i><span lang="la">lex</span></i> are alike that which is laid down, just as <i><span lang="de">Gesetz</span></i> is that which is set
(<i><span lang="la">setzen</span></i>). This interpretation is quite consistent with the original possession
by <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i> of a wider meaning than statute, as already explained. We still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>speak of laying down terms, conditions, and propositions, no less than of
laying down commands, rules, and laws. <i><span lang="la">Lex</span></i>, however, is otherwise and
variously derived from or connected with, <i><span lang="la">ligare</span></i>, to bind,<a id='r507'></a><a href='#f507' class='c016'><sup>[507]</sup></a> <i><span lang="la">legere</span></i>, to read,<a id='r508'></a><a href='#f508' class='c016'><sup>[508]</sup></a>
and <span lang="grc">λέγειν</span>, to say or speak.<a id='r509'></a><a href='#f509' class='c016'><sup>[509]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is true indeed that by several good authorities it is held that the
original meaning of <i><span lang="la">lagu</span></i> and law is that which lies, not that which has been
laid or settled—that which is customary, not that which is established by
authority.<a id='r510'></a><a href='#f510' class='c016'><sup>[510]</sup></a> The root LAGH, however, must contain both the transitive
and intransitive senses, and I do not know what evidence there is for the
exclusion of the former from the signification of the derivative <em>law</em>.
Moreover, there seems no ground for attributing to <i><span lang="la">lagu</span></i> the meaning of
custom. It seems from the first to have meant the product of authority,
not that of use and wont. It is <i><span lang="la">statutum</span></i>, not <i><span lang="la">consuetudo</span></i>. As soon as we
meet with it, it is equivalent to <i><span lang="la">dom</span></i>. The analogy also of <i><span lang="la">lex</span></i>, <i><span lang="de">gesetz</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">dom</span></i>,
<span lang="grc">θεσμός</span>, and other similar terms is in favour of the interpretation here
preferred.<a id='r511'></a><a href='#f511' class='c016'><sup>[511]</sup></a></p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>APPENDIX II.<br> <span class='c013'>THE THEORY OF SOVEREIGNTY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In discussing the theory of the state, we noticed the distinction between
sovereign and subordinate power.<a id='r512'></a><a href='#f512' class='c016'><sup>[512]</sup></a> The former is that which, within its
own sphere, is absolute and uncontrolled, while the latter is that which is
subject to the control of some power superior and external to itself. We
have now to consider in relation to this distinction a celebrated doctrine
which we may term Hobbes’s theory of sovereignty. It was not, indeed,
originated by the English philosopher, but is due rather to the celebrated
French publicist Bodin, from whom it first received definite recognition
as a central element of political doctrine. In the writings of Hobbes,
however, it assumes greater prominence and receives more vigorous and
clear-cut expression, and it is to his advocacy and to that of his modern
followers that its reception in England must be chiefly attributed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The theory in question may be reduced to three fundamental propositions:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. That sovereign power is essential in every state;</p>

<p class='c007'>2. That sovereign power is indivisible;</p>

<p class='c007'>3. That sovereign power is unlimited and illimitable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first of these propositions must be accepted as correct, but the
second and third would seem to have no solid foundation. The matter,
however, is one of very considerable obscurity and complexity, and demands
careful consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>Sovereignty essential.</em> It seems clear that every political society
involves the presence of supreme power. For otherwise all power would
be subordinate, and this supposition involves the absurdity of a series of
superiors and inferiors <i><span lang="la">ad infinitum</span></i>. Yet although this is so, there is
nothing to prevent the sovereignty which is thus essential from being wholly
or partly <em>external</em> to the state. It is, indeed, only in the case of those states
which are both independent and fully sovereign that the sovereignty is
wholly internal, no part of it being held or exercised <i><span lang="la">ab extra</span></i> by any other
authority. When a state is dependent, that is to say, merely a separately
organised portion of a larger body politic, the sovereign power is vested
wholly or in part in the larger unity, and not in the dependency itself.
Similarly when a state, though independent, is only semi-sovereign, its
autonomy is impaired through the possession and exercise of a partial
sovereignty by the superior state. In all cases, therefore, sovereign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>power is necessarily present somewhere, but it is not in all<a id='t468'></a> cases to be found
in its entirety within the borders of the state itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>Indivisible sovereignty.</em>—Every state, it is said, necessarily involves
not merely sovereignty, but a <em>sovereign</em>, that is to say, one person or one
body of persons in whom the totality of sovereign power is vested. Such
power, it is said, cannot be shared between two or more persons. It is not
denied that the single supreme body may be composite, as the English
Parliament is. But it is alleged that whenever there are in this way two
or more bodies of persons in whom sovereign power is vested, they necessarily
possess it as joint tenants of the whole, and cannot possess it as
tenants in severalty of different parts. The whole sovereignty may be in
A., or the whole of it in B., or the whole of it in A. and B. jointly, but it is
impossible that part of it should be in A. and the residue in B.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may test this doctrine by applying it to the British constitution.
We shall find that this constitution in no way conforms to the principles
of Hobbes on this point, but is on the contrary a clear instance of divided
sovereignty. The <i><span lang="la">legislative</span></i> sovereignty resides in the Crown and the
two Houses of Parliament, but the <i><span lang="la">executive</span></i> sovereignty resides in the Crown
by itself, the Houses of Parliament having no share in it. It will be understood
that we are here dealing exclusively with the law or legal theory of
the constitution. The practice is doubtless different; for in practice the
House of Commons has obtained complete control over the executive
government. In practice the ministers are the servants of the legislature
and responsible to it. In law they are the servants of the Crown, through
whom the Crown exercises that sovereign executive power which is vested
in it by law, independently of the legislature altogether.</p>

<p class='c007'>In law, then, the executive power of the Crown is sovereign, being
absolute and uncontrolled within its own sphere. This sphere is not
indeed unlimited. There are many things which the Crown cannot do;
it cannot pass laws or impose taxes. But what it can do it does with
sovereign power. By no other authority in the state can its powers be
limited, or the exercise of them controlled, or the operation of them annulled.
It may be objected by the advocates of the theory in question
that the executive is under the control of the legislature, and that the
sum total of sovereign power is therefore vested in the latter, and is not
divided between it and the executive. The reply is that the Crown is not
merely itself a part of the legislature, but a part without whose consent the
legislature cannot exercise any fragment of its own power. No law
passed by the two Houses of Parliament is operative unless the Crown
consents to it. How, then, can the legislature control the executive?
Can a man be subject to himself? A power over a person, which cannot
be exercised without that person’s consent, is no power over him at all. A
person is subordinate to a body of which he is himself a member, only if that
body has power to act notwithstanding his dissent. A dissenting minority,
for example, may be subordinate to the whole assembly. But this is not
the position of the Crown.</p>

<p class='c007'>The English constitution, therefore, recognises a sovereign executive,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>no less than a sovereign legislature. Each is supreme within its own
sphere; and the two authorities are kept from conflict by the fact that
the executive is one member of the composite legislature. The supreme
legislative power is possessed jointly by the Crown and the two Houses
of Parliament, but the supreme executive power is held in severalty by
the Crown. When there is no Parliament, that is to say, in the interval
between the dissolution of one Parliament and the election of another, the
supreme legislative power is non-existent, but the supreme executive power
is retained unimpaired by the Crown.<a id='r513'></a><a href='#f513' class='c016'><sup>[513]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This is not all, however, for, until the passing of the Parliament Act,
1911, the British constitution recognised a supreme judicature, as well
as a supreme legislature and executive. The House of Lords in its judicial
capacity as a court of final appeal was sovereign. Its judgments were subject
to no further appeal, and its acts were subject to no control. What it
declared for law no other authority known to the constitution could
dispute. Without its own consent its judicial powers could not be impaired
or controlled, nor could their operation be annulled. The consent of this
sovereign judicature was no less essential to legislation, than was the
consent of the sovereign executive. The House of Lords, therefore,
held in severalty the supreme judicial power, while it shared the supreme
legislative power with the Crown and the House of Commons.<a id='r514'></a><a href='#f514' class='c016'><sup>[514]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>Illimitable sovereignty.</em> Sovereign power is declared by the theory
in question to be not merely essential and indivisible, but also illimitable.
Not only is it uncontrolled within its own province, but that province
is infinite in extent. “It appeareth plainly to my understanding,” says
Hobbes,<a id='r515'></a><a href='#f515' class='c016'><sup>[515]</sup></a> “both from reason and Scripture, that the sovereign power,
whether placed in one man, as in monarchy, or in one assembly of men, as
in popular and aristocratical commonwealths, is as great as possibly men
can be imagined to make it.... And whosoever, thinking sovereign power
too great, will seek to make it less, must subject himself to the power that
can limit it; that is to say, to a greater.” So Austin:<a id='r516'></a><a href='#f516' class='c016'><sup>[516]</sup></a> “It follows from
the essential difference of a positive law and from the nature of sovereignty
and independent political society, that the power of a monarch properly
so called, or the power of a sovereign number in its collegiate and sovereign
capacity, is incapable of legal limitation.... Supreme power limited
by positive law is a flat contradiction in terms.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This argument confounds the limitation of power with the subordination
of it. That sovereignty cannot within its own sphere be subject to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>any control is self-evident, for it follows from the very definition of this
species of power. But that this sphere is necessarily universal is a totally
different proposition, and one which cannot be supported. It does not
follow that if a man is free from the constraint of any one stronger than
himself, his physical power is therefore infinite.</p>

<p class='c007'>In considering this matter we must distinguish between power in fact
and power in law. For here as elsewhere that which is true in law may
not be true in fact, and <i><span lang="la">vice versa</span></i>. A <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> limitation of sovereign power
may not be also a <i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i> limitation of it, and conversely the legal theory
of the constitution may recognise limitations which are non-existent in
fact.<a id='r517'></a><a href='#f517' class='c016'><sup>[517]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>That sovereign power may be, and indeed necessarily is, limited <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i>
is sufficiently clear. Great as is the power of the government of a modern
and civilised state, there are many things which it not merely ought not to
do, but cannot do. They are in the strictest sense of the term beyond its
<i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> competence. For the power of a sovereign depends on and is
measured by two things: first the physical force which he has at his command,
and which is the essential instrument of his government; and
second, the disposition of the members of the body politic to submit to the
exercise of this force against themselves. Neither of these two things is
unlimited in extent, therefore the <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> sovereignty which is based upon
them is not unlimited either. This is clearly recognised by Bentham.<a id='r518'></a><a href='#f518' class='c016'><sup>[518]</sup></a>
“In this mode of limitation,” he says, “I see not what there is that need
surprise us. By what is it that any degree of power (meaning political
power) is established? It is neither more nor less&#160;... than a habit of
and a disposition to obedience.... This disposition it is as easy, or I am
much mistaken, to conceive as being absent with regard to one sort of acts,
as present with regard to another. For a body, then, which is in other
respects supreme, to be conceived as being with respect to a certain sort of
acts limited, all that is necessary is that this sort of acts be in its description
distinguishable from every other.... These bounds the supreme
body in question has marked out to its authority:  of such a demarcation,
then, what is the effect? Either none at all, or this: that the disposition to
obedience confines itself within these bounds. Beyond them the disposition
is stopped from extending; beyond them the subject is no more prepared
to obey the governing body of his own state than that of any other.
What difficulty, I say, there should be in conceiving a state of things
to subsist, in which the supreme authority is thus limited—what greater
difficulty in conceiving it with this limitation, than without any, I cannot
see. The two states are, I must confess, to me alike conceivable: whether
alike expedient, alike conducive to the happiness of the people, is another
question.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The follower of Hobbes may admit the <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i>, but deny the <i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>limitation of sovereign power. He may contend that even if there are
many things which the sovereign has no power to do in fact, there is and
can be nothing whatever which he has no power to do in law. The law, he
may say, can recognise no limitations in that sovereign power from which
the law itself proceeds.</p>

<p class='c007'>In reply to this it is to be observed that the law is merely the theory
of things as received and operative within courts of justice. It is the
reflection and image of the outer world seen and accepted as authentic by
the tribunals of the state. This being so, whatever is possible in fact is
possible in law, and more also. Whatsoever limitations of sovereign
power may exist in fact may be reflected in and recognised by the law.
To allow that <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> limitations are possible is to allow the possibility of
corresponding limitations <i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i>. If the courts of justice habitually act
upon the principle that certain functions or forms of activity do not,
according to the constitution, pertain to any organ in the body politic, and
therefore lie outside the scope of sovereign power as recognised by the constitution,
then that principle is by virtue of its judicial application a true
principle of law, and sovereign power is limited in law no less than in fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>The contrary view is based on that unduly narrow view of the nature
of law which identifies it with the command of the sovereign issued to
his subjects. In this view, law and legal obligation are co-extensive,
and the legal limitation of supreme power appears to involve the subjection
of the possessor of it to legal obligations in respect to the exercise of
it.<a id='t471'></a> This, of course, conflicts with the very definition of sovereign power,
and is clearly impossible.<a id='r519'></a><a href='#f519' class='c016'><sup>[519]</sup></a> That sovereign power may be legally controlled
within its own province is a self-contradictory proposition; that its province
may have legally appointed bounds is a distinct and valid principle.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is one application of the doctrine of illimitable sovereignty which
is of sufficient importance and interest to deserve special notice. Among
the chief functions of sovereign power is legislation. It follows from the
theory in question, that in every political society there necessarily exists
some single authority possessed of unlimited legislative power. This
power is, indeed, alleged to be the infallible test of sovereignty. In
seeking for that sovereign who, according to the doctrine of Hobbes, is to
be found somewhere in every body politic, all that is necessary is to discover
the person who possesses the power of making and repealing all laws
without exception. He and he alone is the sovereign of the state, for he
necessarily has power over all, and in all, and is subject to none.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to this it is to be observed, that the extent of legislative power
depends on and is measured by the recognition accorded to it by the
tribunals of the state. Any enactment which the law courts decline
to recognise and apply is by that very fact <em>not law</em>, and lies beyond the
legal competence of the body whose enactment it is. And this is so,
whether the enactment proceeds from a borough council or from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>supreme legislature. As the law of England actually stands, there are no
legal limitations on the legislative power of the Imperial Parliament.
No statute passed by it can be rejected as <i><span lang="la">ultra vires</span></i> by any court of law.
This legal rule of legislative omnipotence may be wise or it may not; but
it is difficult to see by what process of reasoning the jurist can demonstrate
that it is theoretically necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>At no very remote period it was considered to be the law of England,
that a statute made by Parliament was void if contrary to reason and
the law of God.<a id='r520'></a><a href='#f520' class='c016'><sup>[520]</sup></a> The rule has now been abandoned by the courts, but it
seems sufficiently obvious that its recognition involves no theoretical
absurdity or impossibility, however inexpedient it may be. Yet it clearly
involves the limitation of the power of the legislature by a rule of law. To
take another example, the most striking illustration of the legislative
omnipotence of the English Parliament is its admitted power of extending
the term for which an existing House of Commons has been elected.
Delegates appointed by the people for a fixed time have the legal power of
extending the period of their own delegated authority. It is difficult to
see any theoretical objection to a rule of the opposite import. Why
should not the courts of law recognise and apply the principle that an
existing Parliament is sovereign only during the limited time for which it
was originally appointed, and is destitute of any power of extending that
time? And in such a case would not the authority of the supreme legislature
be limited by a rule of law?</p>

<p class='c007'>The exercise of legislative power is admittedly subject to legal <em>conditions</em>;
why not, then, to legal <em>limitations</em>? If the law can regulate the <em>manner</em> of
the exercise of legislative power, why not also its <em>matter</em>? As the law
stands, Parliament may repeal a statute in the same session and in the
same manner in which it was passed. What, then, would be the effect
of a statute providing that no statute should be repealed save by an absolute
majority in both Houses? Would it not create good law, and so prevent
either itself or any other statute from being repealed save in manner
so provided? What if it is provided further, that no statute shall be
repealed until after ten years from the date of its enactment? Is such
a statutory provision void? And if valid, will it not be applied by the law courts,
so that any attempt to repeal either it or any other statute less than
ten years old will be disregarded, as beyond the competence of Parliament?
And if a statute can be made unrepealable for ten years, how
is it <em>legally impossible</em> that it should be made unrepealable for ever?
Such a rule may be very unwise, but by what argument are we to prove
that it involves a logical absurdity?</p>

<p class='c007'>In respect of its legislative omnipotence the English Parliament is
almost unique in modern times. Most modern constitutions impose
more or less stringent limitations upon the powers of the legislature
In the United States of America neither Congress nor any State Legislature
possesses unrestricted powers. They cannot alter the constitutions by
which they have been established, and those constitutions expressly withdraw
certain matters from their jurisdiction. Where, then, is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>sovereignty vested? The reply made is that these constitutions contain provisions
for their alteration by some other authority than the ordinary
legislature, and that the missing legislative power is therefore to be found
in that body to which the right of altering the constitution has been thus
entrusted. In the United States the sovereignty, it is said, is vested not in
Congress, but in a majority of three-fourths of the State Legislatures; this
composite body has absolute power to alter the constitution, and is therefore
unbound by any of the provisions of it, and is so possessed of unlimited
legislative power.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, whenever the constitution has thus entrusted absolute powers
of amendment to some authority other than the ordinary legislature,
this is a perfectly valid reply. But what shall we say of a constitution
which, while it prohibits alteration by the ordinary legislature, provides
no other method of effecting constitutional amendments? There is no
logical impossibility in such a constitution, yet it would be clearly unalterable
in law. That it would be amended in defiance of the law cannot
be doubted, for a constitution which will not bend will sooner or later
break. But all questions as to civil and supreme power are questions as to
what is possible within, not without, the limits of the constitution. If
there is no constitution which meets with due observance, there is no
body politic, and the theory of political government is deprived of any
subject-matter to which it can apply. The necessary <i><span lang="la">datum</span></i> of all problems
relating to sovereignty is the existence and observance of a definite scheme
of organised structure and operation, and it is with this <i><span lang="la">datum</span></i> and presupposition
that we must discuss the question of the extent of legislative
power.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even where a constitution is not wholly, it may be partly unchangeable
in law. Certain portions of it may on their original establishment be
declared permanent and fundamental, beyond the reach even of the
authority to which in other respects the amendment of the constitution is
entrusted. Article V. of the Constitution of the United States of America
provides that no State shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate
without its own consent. Having regard to this provision, what body is
there in the United States which has vested in it unlimited legislative
power? The same Article provides that certain portions of the Constitution
shall be unalterable until the year 1808. What became of sovereign
power in the meantime?<a id='r521'></a><a href='#f521' class='c016'><sup>[521]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>APPENDIX III.<br> <span class='c013'>THE MAXIMS OF THE LAW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Legal maxims are the proverbs of the law. They have the same merits
and defects as other proverbs, being brief and pithy statements of partial
truths. They express general principles without the necessary qualifications
and exceptions, and they are therefore much too absolute to be
taken as trustworthy guides to the law. Yet they are not without their
uses. False and misleading when literally read, these established formulae
provide useful means for the expression of leading doctrines of the law in
a form which is at the same time brief and intelligible. They constitute
a species of legal shorthand, useful to the lawyer, but dangerous to any
one else; for they can be read only in the light of expert knowledge of
that law of which they are the elliptical expression.</p>

<p class='c007'>The language of legal maxims is almost invariably Latin, for they are
commonly derived from the civil law, either literally or by adaptation,
and most of those which are not to be found in the Roman sources are the
invention of medieval jurists. The following is a list of the more familiar
and important of them, together with brief comments and references.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>1. <span class='sc'><span lang="la">Actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea.</span></span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Leges Henrici Primi, V. 28. (Thorpe’s Ancient Laws and Institutes
of England, I. 511.) Coke’s Third Institute, f. 6.</p>

<p class='c007'>The act alone does not make the doer of it guilty, unless it is done with
a guilty mind. Material without formal wrongdoing is not a ground of
liability. The presence either of wrongful intent or of culpable negligence
is a necessary condition of responsibility. See §§ 127, 132, 145.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>2. <span class='sc'><span lang="la">Adversus extraneos vitiosa possessio prodesse solet.</span></span></h3>

<p class='c015'>D. 41. 2. 53.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prior possession is a good title of ownership against all who cannot
show a better. In the civil law, however, from which this maxim is
derived, it has a more special application, and relates to the conditions
of possessory remedies. See § 161.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>3. <span class='sc'><span lang="la">Apices juris non sunt jura.</span></span></h3>

<p class='c015'>10 Co. Rep. 126. <em>Cf.</em> D. 17. 1. 29. 4: <span lang="la">Non congruit de apicibus juris
disputare.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>Legal principles must not be carried to their most extreme consequences,
regardless of equity and good sense. A principle valid within certain
limits becomes false when applied beyond these limits. The law must
avoid the falsehood of extremes. See § 10.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>4. <span class='sc'><span lang="la">Cessante ratione legis cessat lex ipsa.</span></span></h3>

<p class='c015'>In the application of this maxim we must distinguish between common
and statute law.</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) <em>Common law.</em> A legal principle must be read in the light of the
reason for which it was established. It must not be carried further than
this reason warrants, and if the <i><span lang="la">ratio legis</span></i> wholly fails, the law will fail also.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) <em>Statute law.</em> To statute law the maxim has only a limited application,
for such law depends upon the authority of the <i><span lang="la">litera legis</span></i>. It is
only when the letter of the law is imperfect, that recourse may be had to
the reason of it as a guide to its due interpretation. The maxim in
question, therefore, is valid only as a rule of restrictive interpretation.
The complementary rule of extensive interpretation is, Ubi eadem ratio
ibi idem jus. See Vangerow, I. sect. 25.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>5. <b><span lang="la">Cogitationis poenam nemo patitur.</span></b></h3>

<p class='c015'>D. 48. 19. 18.</p>

<p class='c007'>The thoughts and intents of men are not punishable. The law takes
notice only of the overt and external act. In exceptional cases, however,
the opposite maxim is applicable: <span lang="la">Voluntas reputatur pro facto</span>—The
law takes the will for the deed. See § 137.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>6. <span class='sc'><span lang="la">Communis error facit jus.</span></span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Coke’s Fourth Inst. f. 240. <em>Cf.</em> D. 33. 10. 3. 5: Error jus facit.</p>

<p class='c007'>A precedent, even though erroneous, will make valid law, if its authority
has been so widely accepted and relied on that its reversal has become
inexpedient in the interests of justice. See § 65.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>7. <span class='sc'><span lang="la">Cuius est solum eius est usque ad coelum.</span></span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Co. Litt. 4 a. 9 Co. Rep. 54. See § 155.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>8. <span class='sc'><span lang="la">De minimis non curat lex.</span></span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Cro. Eliz. 353. <em>Cf.</em> the medieval maxim of the Civilians: Minima non
curat praetor. Dernburg, Pandekten, I. § 140. n. 5.</p>

<p class='c007'>The law takes no account of trifles. This is a maxim which relates to
the ideal, rather than to the actual law. The tendency to attribute undue
importance to mere matters of form—the failure to distinguish adequately
between the material and the immaterial—is a characteristic defect of
legal systems. See § 10.</p>

Ex nudo pacto&#160;... actionem jure nostro nasci non potuisse.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>In English law this maxim expresses the necessity of a legal consideration
for the validity of a contract. <i><span lang="la">Nudum pactum</span></i> is <i><span lang="la">pactum sine causa
promittendi</span></i>. In the civil law, however, the maxim means, on the contrary,
that an agreement, to become binding, must fall within one of the recognised
classes of legally valid contracts. There was no general principle
that an agreement, as such, had the force of law. See § 124.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>10. <span class='sc'><span lang="la">Ex turpi causa non oritur actio.</span></span></h3>

<p class='c007'>An agreement contrary to law or morals can give rise to no right of
action in any party to it, either for the enforcement of it, or for the
recovery of property parted with in pursuance of it. <em>Cf.</em> the maxim: <span lang="la">In

<p class='c015'>Cicero, Pro Milone, IV. 10.</p>

<p class='c007'>This maxim has a double application: (1) As between the state and
its external enemies, the laws are absolutely silent. No alien enemy has
any claim to the protection of the laws or of the courts of justice. He is
destitute of any legal standing before the law, and the government may
do as it pleases with him and his. (2) Even as regards the rights of subjects
and citizens, the law may be put to silence by <em>necessity</em> in times of civil
disturbance. Necessitas non habet legem. Extrajudicial force may lawfully
supersede the ordinary process and course of law, whenever it is
needed for the protection of the state and the public order against illegal

made to exhibit these three <i><span lang="la">praecepta juris</span></i> as based on a logical division
of the sphere of legal obligation into three parts. This, however, is not
the case. They are simply different modes of expressing the same thing,
and each of them is wide enough to cover the whole field of legal duty.
The third of them, indeed, is simply a variant of the received definition

  <h2 class='c005'>APPENDIX IV.<br> <span class='c013'>THE DIVISIONS OF THE LAW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>English law possesses no received and authentic scheme of orderly
arrangement. Exponents of this system have commonly shown themselves
too little careful of appropriate division and classification, and too
tolerant of chaos. Yet we must guard ourselves against the opposite
extreme, for theoretical jurists have sometimes fallen into the contrary
error of attaching undue importance to the element of form. They have
esteemed too highly both the possibility and the utility of ordering the
world of law in accordance with the straitest principles of logical development.
It has been said by a philosopher concerning human institutions
in general, and therefore concerning the law and its arrangement, that
they exist for the uses of mankind, and not in order that the angels in
heaven may delight themselves with the view of their perfections. In
the classification of legal principles the requirements of practical convenience
must prevail over those of abstract theory. The claims of logic
must give way in great measure to those of established nomenclature and
familiar usage; and the accidents of historical development must often
be suffered to withstand the rules of scientific order. Among the various
points of view of which most branches of the law admit, there are few, if
any, which may be wisely adopted throughout their whole extent, and
among the various alternative principles of classification, expedience
allows of no rigidly exclusive and consistent choice. There are few
distinctions, however important in their leading applications, which may
not rightly, as they fade towards the boundary line, be replaced by others
which there possess a deeper significance. We may rest content, therefore,
if, within the limits imposed by the needful conformity to received
speech and usage, each portion of the law is dealt with in such of its
aspects as best reveals its most important characters and relations, and
in such order as is most consistent with lucid and concise exposition.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>1. <em>The Introductory Portion of the Law.</em></h3>

<p class='c015'>The first portion of the <i><span lang="la">corpus juris</span></i> is of an introductory nature, consisting
of all those rules which by virtue of their preliminary character or
of the generality of their application cannot be appropriately relegated
to any special department. This introduction may be divided into four
parts. The first of them is concerned with the sources of law. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>comprises all those rules in accordance with which new law obtains recognition
and the older law is modified or abrogated. It is here, for example,
that we must look for the legal doctrine as to the operation of precedent,
custom, and legislation. The second part of the Introduction deals with
the interpretation of law. Here we shall find the rules in accordance
with which the language of the law is to be construed, and also the
definitions of those terms which are fitly dealt with here, because common
to several departments of the law. In the third place the Introduction
comprises the principles of private international law—the principles, that
is to say, which determine the occasional exclusion of English law from
English courts of justice, and the recognition and enforcement therein of
some foreign system which possesses for some reason a better claim to
govern the case in hand. Fourthly and lastly, it is necessary to treat as
introductory a number of miscellaneous rules which are of so general an
application as not to be appropriately dealt with in any special department
of the legal system.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>2. <em>Private and Public Law.</em></h3>

<p class='c015'>After the Introduction comes the body of Private Law as opposed to
that of Public Law. By general consent this Roman distinction between
<i><span lang="la">jus privatum</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">jus publicum</span></i> is accepted as the most fundamental
division of the <i><span lang="la">corpus juris</span></i>. Public law comprises the rules which specially
relate to the structure, powers, rights, and activities of the state. Private
law includes all the residue of legal principles. It comprises all those
rules which specially concern the subjects of the state in their relations
to each other, together with those rules which are common to the state
and its subjects. In many of its actions and relations the state stands on
the same level as its subjects, and submits itself to the ordinary principles
of private law. It owns land and chattels, makes contracts, employs
agents and servants, and enters into various forms of commercial undertaking;
and in respect of all these matters it differs little in its juridical
position from its own subjects. Public law, therefore, is not the <em>whole</em> of
the law that is applicable to the state and to its relations with its subjects,
but only those parts of it which are different from the private law concerning
the subjects of the state and their relations to each other. For
this reason private law precedes public in the order of exposition. The
latter presupposes a knowledge of the former.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two divisions of public law are constitutional and administrative
law. It is impossible, however, to draw any rigid fine between these two,
for they differ merely in the degree of importance pertaining to their
subject-matters. Constitutional law deals with the structure, powers, and
functions of the supreme power in the state, together with those of all the
more important of the subordinate departments of government. Administrative
law, on the other hand, is concerned with the multitudinous forms
and instruments in and through which the lower ranges of governmental
activity manifest themselves.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>3. <em>Civil and Criminal Law.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Within the domain of private law the division which calls for primary
recognition is that between civil and criminal law. Civil law is that
which is concerned with the enforcement of rights, while criminal law is
concerned with the punishment of wrongs. We have examined and
rejected the opinion that crimes are essentially offences against the state
or the community at large, while civil wrongs are committed against
private persons. According to the acceptance or rejection of this opinion,
criminal law pertains either to public or to private law. Our classification
of it as private is unaffected by the fact that certain crimes, such as treason
and sedition, are offences against the state. As already explained, logical
consistency in the division of the law is attainable only if we are prepared
to disregard the requirements of practical convenience. Greater weight
is wisely attributed to the fact that treason and robbery are both crimes,
than to the fact that the one is an offence against the state and the other
an offence against an individual.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as the law which is common to both state and subject is considered
under the head of private law alone, so the law which is common to crimes
and to civil injuries is dealt with under the head of civil law alone. It is
obvious that there is a great body of legal principles common to the two
departments. The law as to theft involves the whole law as to the
acquisition of property in chattels, and the law of bigamy involves a
considerable portion of the law of marriage. The arrangement sanctioned
by usage and convenience is, therefore, to expound first the civil law in
its entirety, and thereafter, under the title of criminal law, such portions
of the law of crime as are not already comprehended in the former
department.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>4. <em>Substantive Law and the Law of Procedure.</em></h3>

<p class='c015'>Civil and criminal law are each divisible into two branches, namely
substantive law and the law of procedure, a distinction the nature of
which has already been sufficiently considered.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>5. <em>Divisions of the Substantive Civil Law.</em></h3>

<p class='c015'>The substantive civil law may be conveniently divided, by reference to
the nature of the rights with which it is concerned, into three great
branches, namely the law of property, the law of obligations, and the law
of status. The first deals with proprietary rights <i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i>, the second with
proprietary rights <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>, and the third with personal as opposed to
proprietary rights.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>6. <em>The Law of Property.</em></h3>

<p class='c015'>Although the distinction between the law of property and that of
obligations is a fundamental one, which must be recognised in any orderly
scheme of classification, there is a great part of the substantive civil law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>which is common to both of these branches of it. Thus the law of
inheritance or succession concerns all kinds of proprietary rights whether
<i><span lang="la">in rem</span></i> or <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>. So also with the law of trusts and that of securities.
In general the most convenient method of dealing with these common
elements is to consider them once for all in the law of property, thus
confining the law of obligations to those rules which are peculiar to obligations:
just as the elements common to civil and criminal law are dealt
with in the civil law, and those common to private and public law in
private law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The law of property is divisible into the following chief branches:
(1) the law of corporeal property, namely the ownership of land and
chattels; (2) the law of immaterial objects of property, such as patents,
trade-marks, and copyrights; (3) the law of encumbrances or <i><span lang="la">jura in re
aliena</span></i>, such as tenancies, servitudes, trusts, and securities; (4) the law
of testamentary and intestate succession.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>7. <em>The Law of Obligations.</em></h3>

<p class='c015'>The law of obligations comprises the law of contracts, the law of torts,
and the law of those miscellaneous obligations which are neither contractual
nor delictal. It may be convenient to consider under the same
head the law of insolvency, inasmuch as the essential significance of
insolvency is to be found in its operation as a method of discharging
debts and liabilities. Alternatively, however, this branch of law may be
included in the law of property, inasmuch as it deals with one mode of
divesting proprietary rights in general. In the law of obligations is also
to be classed the law of companies, this being essentially a development
of the law of the contract of partnership. Under the head of companies
are to be comprised all forms of <em>contractual</em> incorporation, all other bodies
corporate pertaining either to public law or to special departments of
private law with which they are exclusively concerned. The <em>general</em>
doctrine as to corporations is to be found in the introductory department
of the law.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>8. <em>The Law of Status.</em></h3>

<p class='c015'>The law of status is divisible into two branches dealing respectively with
domestic and extra-domestic status. The first of these is the law of family
relations, and deals with the nature, acquisition, and loss of all those
personal rights, duties, liabilities, and disabilities which are involved in
domestic relationship. It falls into three divisions, concerned respectively
with marriage, parentage, and guardianship. The second branch of the
law of status is concerned with all the personal rights, duties, liabilities,
and disabilities, which are external to the law of the family. It deals, for
example, with the personal status of minors (in relation to others than
their parents), of married women (in relation to others than their husbands
and children), of lunatics, aliens, convicts, and any other classes of persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>whose personal condition is sufficiently characteristic to call for separate
consideration.<a id='r522'></a><a href='#f522' class='c016'><sup>[522]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There is one class of personal rights which ought in logical strictness to
be dealt with in the law of status, but is commonly and more conveniently
considered elsewhere—those rights, namely, which are called <em>natural</em>,
because they belong to all men from their birth, instead of being subsequently
acquired: for example, the rights of life, liberty, reputation,
and freedom from bodily harm. These are personal rights and not proprietary;
they constitute part of a man’s status, not part of his estate;
yet we seldom find them set forth in the law of status.<a id='r523'></a><a href='#f523' class='c016'><sup>[523]</sup></a> The reason is that
such rights, being natural and not acquired, call for no consideration,
except in respect of their <em>violation</em>. They are adequately dealt with,
therefore, under the head of civil and criminal wrongs. The exposition
of the law of libel, for example, which is contained in the law of torts,
involves already the proposition that a man has a right to his reputation;
and there is no occasion, therefore, for a bald statement to that effect in
the later law of status.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. See on this subject Reid’s Philosophical Works, Essay on the Active Powers,
V. 3. (Of systems of natural jurisprudence.) Also Dugald Stewart’s Works,
VII. 256 (Hamilton’s ed.).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. The term civil law, though once in common use to indicate the law of the
land, has been partly superseded in recent times by the improper substitute,
<em>positive</em> law. <i><span lang="la">Jus positivum</span></i> was a title invented by medieval jurists to denote
law made or established (<i><span lang="la">positum</span></i>) by human authority, as opposed to that <i><span lang="la">jus
naturale</span></i> which was uncreated and immutable. It is from this contrast that the
term derives all its point and significance. It is not permissible, therefore, to
confine positive law to the law of the land. All is positive which is not natural.
International and canon law, for example, are kinds of <i><span lang="la">jus positivum</span></i> no less than
the civil law itself. See Aquinas, Summa, 2. 2. q. 57 (De Jure) art. 2. <span lang="la">Utrum
jus convenienter dividatur in jus naturale et jus positivum.</span> See also Suarez,
De Legibus, I. 3. 13: <span lang="la">(Lex) positiva dicta est, quasi addita naturali legi.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>The term civil law possesses several other meanings, which are not likely,
however, to create any confusion. It often means the law of Rome (<i><span lang="la">corpus juris
civilis</span></i>) as opposed more especially to the canon law (<i><span lang="la">corpus juris canonici</span></i>), these
being the two great systems by which, in the Middle Ages, State and Church
were respectively governed. At other times it is used to signify not the whole
law of the land, but only the residue of it after deducting some particular
portion having a special title of its own. Thus civil is opposed to criminal law,
to ecclesiastical law, to military law, and so on.</p>

<p class='c007'>The term civil law is derived from the <i><span lang="la">jus civile</span></i> of the Romans. Quod quisque
populus ipse sibi jus constituit, id ipsius proprium civitatis est vocaturque jus
civile, quasi jus proprium ipsius civitatis. Just. Inst. I. 2. 1.</p>

See also Puchta’s Encyklopädie, being the introductory portion of his Cursus
der Institutionen, translated by Hastie (Outlines of Jurisprudence, 1887). The
term general jurisprudence (allgemeine Rechtslehre) is occasionally applied to
this form of literature. See Holtzendorff’s Encyklopädie der Rechtswissenschaft,
5th ed. 1890. (Elemente der allgemeinen Rechtslehre, by Merkel.)</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. The term jurisprudence is used by French lawyers as the equivalent of
that which English lawyers call case-law—the development of the law by
judicial decisions. “Jurisprudence—la manière dont un tribunal juge
habituellement telle ou telle question” (Littré). Jurisprudence in this sense
is contrasted with doctrine, <em>i.e.</em>, extrajudicial legal literature.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. The term sanction is derived from Roman law. The <i><span lang="la">sanctio</span></i> was originally
that part of a statute which established a penalty, or made other provision in
respect of the disregard of its injunctions. D. 48. 19. 41. By an easy transition
it has come to mean the penalty itself.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. It is to be noted, therefore, that the distinction between law and fact
depends not on the person by whom, but on the manner in which, the matter is
determined. Yet, although this is so, an illogical and careless usage of speech
sometimes classes as questions of law all those which are for the decision of
judges, irrespective of the existence or non-existence of legal principles for their
determination.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is worth notice that questions of fact, left to the determination of judges,
tend to be transformed into questions of law, by the operation of judicial precedent.
In the hands of judges decisions of fact beget principles of law, while
the decisions of juries have no such law-creating efficacy. This is a matter
which we shall consider at length in connection with the theory of precedent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distinction between law and fact, with special reference to trial by jury,
is very fully considered by Thayer in his Preliminary Treatise on the Law of
Evidence, pp. 183–262. See also Terry’s Leading Principles of Anglo-American
Law, pp. 53–62.</p>

People, that is, the whole body of the community, regarded not as incorporated

the creation of the state, because instances can be adduced where law existed

as well as of international practice as a source of law; and they fail to make

consent. Moreover, the word consent is itself used ambiguously and
vaguely, and it is often difficult to know whether it means international agreement,
or international opinion, or the harmonious practice of states.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r85'>85</a>. As late as the closing years of Henry III. it was found necessary to resort
to special statutory enactments against a lawless recurrence to the older system.
The statute of Marlborough (52 Hen. III. c. 1) recites that “At the time of a
commotion late stirred up within this realm, and also since, many great men
and divers other have disdained to accept justice from the King and his Court,
like as they ought and were wont in time of the King’s noble progenitors, and
also in his time, but took great revenges and distresses of their neighbours and
of others, until they had amends and fines at their own pleasure.” The statute
thereupon provides that “All persons, as well of high as of low estate, shall
receive justice in the King’s Court, and none from henceforth shall take any
such revenge or distress of his own authority without award of our Court.”
Long after the strength of the law of England had succeeded in suppressing
the practice, the right of private war continued to be recognised and regulated
by law in the more feebly governed states of the Continent. An interesting
account of the matter is given by M. Nys in his Origines du Droit International
(1894), ch. 5. A reminiscence of the older doctrine and practice may be seen
to this day in England in that “peace of our Lord the King” which every
criminal is formally charged in his indictment with having broken. The King
of England made good at an early date his monopoly of war, and all private
war or violence was and is a violation of his peace. As to the King’s peace,
see Sir F. Pollock’s Oxford Lectures, pp. 65–90; Select Essays in Anglo-American
Legal History, II. pp. 403–417. An interesting picture of the relations
between law and private force in the primitive community of Iceland is to

<p class='c007'><a href='#r87'>87</a>. Austin’s theory of the distinction is somewhat different from Blackstone’s,
for he makes the distinction between public and private wrongs, and therefore
between criminal and civil wrongs, turn not on the public or private nature of
the right violated, but solely on the public or private nature of the proceeding
taken in respect of its violation. “Where the wrong,” he says (p. 502), “is a
civil injury, the sanction is enforced at the discretion of the party whose right
has been violated. Where the wrong is a crime, the sanction is enforced at the
discretion of the sovereign.” This theory, however, is exposed to the same
objections as those which may be made to Blackstone’s, and it need not be
separately considered.</p>

penalty is payable to the person injured. It is enough in such a case that the
receipt of the penalty should not be reckoned as or towards the compensation
of the recipient. A good example of this is the Roman <i><span lang="la">actio furti</span></i> by which
the owner of stolen goods could recover twice their value from the thief by
way of penalty, without prejudice nevertheless to a further action for the
recovery of the goods themselves or their value.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r96'>96</a>. “The primary function of the state,” says Herbert Spencer (Principles of
Ethics II. 204. 208. 214) “or of that agency in which the powers of the state
are centralised, is the function of directing the combined actions of the incorporated
individuals in war. The first duty of the ruling agency is national
defence. What we may consider as measures to maintain inter-tribal justice,
are more imperative, and come earlier, than measures to maintain justice
among individuals.... Once established, this secondary function of the
state goes on developing; and becomes a function next in importance to the
function of protecting against external enemies.... With the progress of
civilisation the administration of justice continues to extend and to become
more efficient.... Between these essential functions and all other functions
there is a division, which, though it cannot in all cases be drawn with precision,
is yet broadly marked.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f97'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r97'>97</a>. It is to be noted that the term war is commonly applied only to the more
extreme forms of extrajudicial force. Rioting would not be termed civil war,
although the difference between them is merely one of degree. Nor would the
punitive expedition of an armed cruiser against a village in the South Sea
Islands be dignified with the name of war, though it differs only in degree from
the blockade or bombardment of the ports of a civilised state. To be perfectly
accurate, therefore, we should oppose the administration of justice not to war,
but to the extrajudicial use of force, counting war as the most important
species of the latter. War, however, so greatly overshadows in importance all
other forms of such force, that it is more convenient to take it as representing
the genus, and to disregard the others.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f98'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r98'>98</a>. The prohibition of the use of extrajudicial force by the King against his
subjects is one of the main provisions of Magna Carta (sec. 39): “No free man
shall be taken or imprisoned or disseized or outlawed or exiled or anyways
destroyed, nor will we go against him, nor will we send against him, save by
the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.” It is submitted
that, subject only to the <i><span lang="la">jus necessitatis</span></i>, this is still the law of England, notwithstanding
the doctrine of military absolutism laid down by Lord Halsbury,
in the name of the Privy Council, in the case of <cite>Ex parte Marais</cite>, (1902) A. C, 109.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f99'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r99'>99</a>. On the original identity and gradual differentiation of the two functions of
the state, see Spencer’s Sociology, II. pp. 493 <em>sqq.</em> “The sword of justice,” he
says at p. 494, “is a phrase sufficiently indicating the truth that action against
the public enemy and action against the private enemy are in the last resort
the same.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f100'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r100'>100</a>. Speaking generally, we may say that the terms subject and citizen are
synonymous. Subjects and citizens are alike those whose relation to the state
is personal and not merely territorial, permanent and not merely temporary.
This equivalence, however, is not absolute. For in the first place, the term
subject is commonly limited to monarchical forms of government, while the
term citizen is more specially applicable in the case of republics. A British
subject becomes by naturalisation a citizen of the United States of America or
of France. In the second place, the term citizen brings into prominence the
rights and privileges of the status, rather than its correlative obligations, while
the reverse is the case with the term subject. Finally it is to be noticed that
the term subject is capable of a different and wider application, in which it
includes all members of the body politic, whether they are citizens (<em>i.e.</em> subjects
<i><span lang="la">stricto sensu</span></i>) or resident aliens. All such persons are subjects, as being subject
to the power of the state and to its jurisdiction, and as owing to it, at least
temporarily, fidelity and obedience. Thus it has been said that: “Every alien
coming into a British colony becomes temporarily a subject of the Crown—bound
by, subject to, and entitled to the benefit of the laws which affect all
British subjects.” <cite>Low</cite> v. <cite>Routledge</cite>, 1 Ch. App. at p. 47. See also <cite>Jeffreys</cite> v.
<cite>Boosey</cite>, 4 H. L. C. 815. So in Hale’s Pleas of the Crown, I. 542, it is said:
“Though the statute speaks of the king’s subjects, it extends to aliens,&#160;...
for though they are not the king’s natural born subjects, they are the king’s
subjects when in England by a local allegiance.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f101'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r101'>101</a>. The possession of political rights is so characteristic and important a
feature of citizenship, that some may be tempted to regard it as the essence
of the matter. This, however, is not so. Women have no political rights, yet
a wife is as much a British subject as her husband is. The distinction between
subject and alien may exist under a despotic government, neither class possessing
any political rights at all.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f102'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r102'>102</a>. British nationality is acquired in the following ways:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(a) By birth in British dominions.</p>

<p class='c007'>(b) By descent from a father or a father’s father born in British
dominions.</p>

<p class='c007'>(c) By the marriage of an alien woman to a British subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>(d) By naturalisation.</p>

<p class='c007'>(e) By continued residence in a territory after it has been conquered or
otherwise acquired by the British Crown.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f103'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r103'>103</a>. On this transition from the national to the territorial idea of the state, see
Maine, Early History of Institutions, pp. 72–76. As to the history of the
conception and law of citizenship, see Salmond on Citizenship and Allegiance,

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f104'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r104'>104</a>. Although states are established for the protection of their members, it is
not necessary that this protection should be absolutely limited to members.
In exceptional cases and to a limited extent the state will use its powers for
the defence and benefit of outsiders. War way be waged on behalf of an
oppressed nation, and the state may intervene, in the interests of justice, in a
quarrel not its own. Nor will it necessarily refuse to administer justice in its
courts even to non-resident aliens. But such external protection is exceptional
and accidental, and does not pertain to the essence of government. A state
is established, not for the defence of all mankind, and not for the maintenance
of right throughout all the earth, but solely for the security of its own members,
and the administration of its own territory. A state which absolutely refused
its protection to all outsiders would none the less adequately fulfil the essential
purposes of a political society.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f105'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r105'>105</a>. The conception of sovereignty is made by many writers the central point
in their theory of the state. They lay down certain fundamental propositions
with respect to the nature of this power: namely, (1) that its existence is
essential in every state; (2) that it is indivisible, and incapable of being shared
between two or more different authorities; and (3) that it is necessarily absolute
and unlimited in law, that is to say, its sphere of action is legally indeterminate.
A discussion of this difficult and important branch of political theory will be
found in an Appendix.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f106'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r106'>106</a>. In international law, therefore, the word state commonly means an independent
state. This is a convenient place in which to call attention to the
variety of allied meanings possessed by the term state. They are the following:</p>

  <dl class='dl_2'>
    <dt>(a)</dt>
    <dd>A political society dependent or independent.
    </dd>
    <dt>(b)</dt>
    <dd>An independent political society.
    </dd>
    <dt>(c)</dt>
    <dd>The government of a political society.
    </dd>
    <dt>(d)</dt>
    <dd>The territory of a political society.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c007'>Except where the context shows that it is not so, we shall use the term in the
first of these senses.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f107'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r107'>107</a>. A composite state may be of a mixed nature, being partly imperial and
partly federal. A federal state may have dependencies, over which it exercises
an imperial government—the foreign conquests, for example, of the United
States of America. So an imperial state may have dependencies, which are
themselves federal states. The Commonwealth of Australia is a federal union
which is a dependency under imperial government.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r109'>109</a>. In addition to the formal, historical, and legal sources of the law, it is necessary
to note and distinguish what may be termed its literary sources, though
this is a Continental, rather than an English use of the term source. The
literary sources are the sources of our knowledge of the law, or rather the
original and authoritative sources of such knowledge, as opposed to later
commentary or literature. The sources of Roman law are in this sense the
compilations of the Emperor Justinian, as contrasted with the works of commentators.
So the sources of English law are the statute-book, the reports,
and the older and authoritative text-books, such as Littleton. The literature,
as opposed to the sources of our law, comprises all modern text-books and
commentaries.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f110'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r110'>110</a>. In the succeeding chapters we shall consider more particularly three of
the legal sources which have been already mentioned, namely legislation,
custom, and precedent. Professional opinion as a source of law pertains to the
Roman, rather than to the English system, and does not call for special examination
here. For an account of it see Bryce, Studies in History and Jurisprudence,
II. pp. 255–269. Agreement will be considered later, in its aspect as a title
of rights, instead of here as a source of law.</p>

D. 1. 3. 32. 1. Considerable doubt, however, exists as to the true relation
between custom and statute in Roman law, owing to a passage in the Code
(C. 8. 53. 2.) which, if read literally, conflicts with the doctrine expressed in the
Digest, and declares custom to be destitute of legal effect if contrary to statute law.
The ingenuity of German jurists has suggested numerous solutions of the
apparent inconsistency, but with no convincing result. See Savigny’s System,
vol. i. Appendix II. Vangerow, Pandekten, I. sect. 16. Dernburg, Pandekten,

<div class='footnote' id='f132'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r132'>132</a>. It is to be noticed that the term custom is often used to mean particular
custom exclusively. Custom (meaning local usage having legal validity) is
opposed to law (meaning the common law of the land). When we find in the
books any proposition laid down as to the legal efficacy or requirements of
custom, it must be carefully ascertained from the context whether the term
does or does not extend to general customs.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f133'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r133'>133</a>. Both in English and foreign law, however, the time of memory was extended
by the allowance of tradition within defined limits. A witness might
testify not only to that which he had himself seen, but to that which he had
been told by others who spoke of their own knowledge. D. 22. 3. 28. Bracton

<div class='footnote' id='f134'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r134'>134</a>. The statute of Westminster I. c. 39, imposed a limitation upon actions for
the recovery of land. It provided that no such action should lie, unless the
claimant or his predecessor in title had had possession of the land claimed at
some time subsequent to the accession of Richard I. The previous common
law rule of limitation for such actions was no other than the rule as to time
immemorial. At common law the claimant had to prove his title and his seisin
by the testimony of living men; therefore he or his predecessors must have
been in possession within time of human memory. The enactment in question
was accordingly construed as laying down a statutory definition of the term
time of memory, and this supposed statutory definition was accepted by the
courts as valid in all departments of the law in which the idea of time immemorial
was relevant. See Blackstone, II. 31; Littleton, sect. 170.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f136'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r136'>136</a>. In limiting the requirement of immemorial antiquity to local customs, we
have, for the sake of simplicity, spoken somewhat more absolutely than the
present state of the authorities warrants. The more common, and, it is believed,
the better opinion is that the law is as stated in the text. There is, however,
some authority for saying that the same requirement exists in the case of
certain general customs also. In <cite>Crouch</cite> v. <cite>Crédit Foncier</cite>, L. R. 8 Q. B. 374,
it was held that modern mercantile custom was powerless to render an English
instrument negotiable, although it is well settled that foreign instruments,
such as the bonds of foreign governments, may be made negotiable in this
way. <cite>Gorgier</cite> v. <cite>Mieville</cite>, 27 R. R. 290. The authority, however, of the case
in question is exceedingly doubtful. See <cite>Goodwin</cite> v. <cite>Robarts</cite>, L. R. 10 Ex. 337;
<cite>Bechuanaland Exploration Co.</cite> v. <cite>London Trading Bank</cite>, (1898) 2 Q. B. 658;
<cite>Edelstein</cite> v. <cite>Schuler</cite>, (1902) 2 K. B. 144; L. Q. R. XV. 130 and 245. There is
no doubt that a great part of our mercantile law has been derived from modern
mercantile custom, and we may assume with some confidence that such custom
still retains the law-creating efficacy which it formerly possessed.</p>

the common law. To give effect to a usage which involves a defiance or
disregard of the law would be obviously contrary to a fundamental principle.
And we quite agree that this would apply quite as strongly to an attempt to
set up a new usage against one which has become settled and adopted by the
common law as to one in conflict with the more ancient rules of the common law
itself.” See also to the same effect <cite>Edie</cite> v. <cite>East India Company</cite>, 2 Burr. 1216.</p>

and principle. It is odd to speak of deciding a case on principle because there
is no legal principle on which it can be decided. To avoid misapprehension,
it may be advisable to point out that decisions as to the meaning of statutes
are always general, and therefore establish precedents and make law. For
such interpretative decisions are necessarily as general as the statutory provisions
interpreted. A question of statutory interpretation is one of fact to
begin with, and is decided on principle; therefore it becomes one of law, and
is for the future decided on authority.</p>

the exercise of it is not merely effectual but rightful. This, however, is not
necessarily the case. It may be effectual and yet wrongful; as when, in
breach of my agreement, I revoke a licence given by me to enter upon my
land. Such revocation is perfectly effectual, but it is a wrongful act, for which
I am liable to the licensee in damages. I had a right (in the sense of power) to
revoke the licence, but I had no right (in the sense of liberty) to do so: <cite>Wood</cite> v.

<div class='footnote' id='f184'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r184'>184</a>. This division of rights into rights (<i><span lang="la">stricto sensu</span></i>), liberties, and powers, is
not intended to be exhaustive. These are the most important kinds of advantages
conferred by the law, but they are not the only kinds. Thus, the
term right is sometimes used to mean an <em>immunity</em> from the legal power of some
other person. The right of a peer to be tried by his peers, for example, is neither
a right in the strict sense, nor a liberty, nor a power. It is an exemption from
trial by jury—an immunity from the power of the ordinary criminal courts.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f185'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r185'>185</a>. A very thorough examination of the conception of a legal right is to be
found in Terry’s Principles of Anglo-American Law (Philadelphia, 1884), a
work of theoretical jurisprudence too little known in England, and characterised
by much subtle analysis of legal conceptions. Rights are there divided (ch. 6,
pp. 84–138) into four kinds, which the author distinguishes as (1) permissive
rights (which we have here termed liberties), (2) facultative rights (which we
have here termed powers), (3) correspondent rights (which are so called because
they correspond to duties, and which we have here termed rights in the strict
sense), and (4) protected rights. These last we have not recognised as being in
truth a class of rights at all. They are, if I understand Mr. Terry correctly,
not rights but the <i><span lang="la">objects</span></i> of rights <i><span lang="la">stricto sensu</span></i>; for example, life, reputation,
liberty, property, domestic relations, &#38;c. That is to say, they are the things in
which a person has an interest, and to which, therefore, he has a right, so soon
as, but not until, the law protects that interest by imposing duties in respect of
it upon other persons. There is no right to reputation apart from and independent
of the right that other persons shall not publish defamatory statements.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f186'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r186'>186</a>. The distinction here drawn between duty and liability may seem to conflict
with the common usage, by which certain kinds of duties are apparently spoken
of as liabilities. Thus we say that a man is liable for his debts. This, however,
may be construed as meaning that he is liable to be sued for them. We
certainly cannot regard liability as a generic term including all kinds of duty.
We do not say that a man is liable not to commit murder, or not to defraud
other persons.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f187'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r187'>187</a>. Of the three classes of rights or legal interests which we have considered,
the first, consisting of those which are the correlative of duties, are by far the
most important. So predominant are they, indeed, that we may regard them as
constituting the principal subject-matter of the law, while the others are merely
accessory. In future, therefore, we shall use the term right in this narrow
and specific sense, except when the context indicates a different usage; and we

<div class='footnote' id='f188'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r188'>188</a>. The term enforcement is here used in a wide sense to include the maintenance
of a right or duty by any form of compulsory legal process, whether civil or
criminal. There is a narrower use of the term, in which it includes only the
case of civil proceedings. It is in this sense that we have already defined civil
justice as being concerned with the enforcement of rights, and criminal justice as
being concerned with the punishment of wrongs. As to the distinction between
recognising and enforcing a right, see Dicey, Conflict of Laws, p. 31, 2nd ed.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f189'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r189'>189</a>. There is another use of the term imperfect duty which pertains to ethics
rather than to jurisprudence, and must be distinguished from that adopted in
the text. According to many writers, an imperfect duty is one of such a
nature that it is not fit for enforcement, but ought properly to be left to the
free will of him whose duty it is. A perfect duty, on the other hand, is one
which a man not merely <em>ought</em> to perform, but may be <em>justly compelled</em> to
perform. The duty to give alms to the poor is imperfect; that of paying
one’s debts is perfect. Perfect duties pertain to the sphere of justice; imperfect
to that of benevolence. The distinction is not equivalent to that between
legal duties and those which are merely moral. A duty may be a perfect duty
of justice, although the actual legal system takes no notice of it; and conversely
an imperfect duty of benevolence may be unjustly made by law the subject of
compulsion. It does not seem possible, however, so to divide the sphere of
duty by a hard and fast line. One of the most noteworthy attempts to do so
is to be seen in Spencer’s Principles of Ethics.</p>

and <i><span lang="la">res incorporalis</span></i> are derived from Roman Law. Just. Inst. II. 2:—<span lang="la">Quaedam

Thus if A. owns land, and makes a declaration of trust in favour of B., the
direct ownership of A. is thereby changed into trust-ownership, and a correlative
beneficial ownership is acquired by B. If A. then conveys the land to

It seems to us that goods which have been delivered to a bailee to
keep for the bailor, such as a gentleman’s plate delivered to his banker, or
his furniture warehoused at the Pantechnicon, would in a popular sense as

<div class='footnote' id='f247'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r247'>247</a>. Delivery by attornment is provided for by the Sale of Goods Act, 1893,
sect. 29 (3): “Where the goods at the time of sale are in the possession of
a third person, there is no delivery by seller to buyer unless and until such
third person acknowledges to the buyer that he holds the goods on his behalf.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f248'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r248'>248</a>. The theory here considered is that which has been made familiar by
Savigny’s celebrated treatise on Possession (Recht des Besitzes, 1803). The
influence of this work was long predominant on the Continent and considerable
in England, and it still finds no small amount of acceptance. A forcible
statement of the objections to Savigny’s doctrine is contained in Ihering’s
Grund des Besitzesschutzes, pp. 160–193.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f249'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r249'>249</a>. Bruns rejects the definition of possession as consisting in the continuing
exercise of a right, and defines it as the continuous possibility of exercising a
right at will. “Just as corporeal possession,” he says (Recht des Besitzes,
p. 475) “consists not in actual dealing with the thing, but only in the power
of dealing with it at will, so incorporeal possession consists not in the actual
exercise of a right, but in the power of exercising it at will; and it is only
because the existence of this power does not become visible as an objective
fact until actual exercise of the right has taken place, that such actual exercise
is recognised as an essential condition of the commencement of possession.”
This however seems incorrect. Possession consists not in the power of exercising
a claim in the future, but in the power of <em>continuing to exercise it</em> from
now onwards.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f250'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r250'>250</a>. Thus in the Civil Code of France it is said (sect. 2228): <span lang="fr">La possession est la
détention ou la jouissance d’une chose ou d’un droit que nous tenons ou que nous
exerçons par nous-mêmes ou par un autre qui la tient ou qui l’exerce en notre
nom.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>The definition of the Italian Civil Code is similar (sect. 685): “Possession is
the detention of a thing or the enjoyment of a right by any person either
personally or through another who detains the thing or exercises the right in his
name.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A good analysis of the generic conception of possession, and of the relation
between its two varieties, is to be found in Baudry-Lacantinerie’s Traité de
Droit Civil (De la Prescription, sect. 199): “Possession is nothing else than
the exercise or enjoyment, whether by ourselves or through the agency of
another, of a real right which we have or claim to have over a thing. It makes
no difference whether this right is one of ownership or one of some other
description, such as <i><span lang="la">ususfructus</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">usus</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">habitatio</span></i>, or <i><span lang="la">servitus</span></i>. The old distinction
between possession and quasi-possession, which was recognised by Roman law
and is still to be found in the doctrine of Pothier, has been rejected, and rightly
so. It was in our opinion nothing more than a result of that confusion between
the right of ownership and the object of that right, which has been at all times
prevalent. Possession is merely the exercise of a right; in reality it is not
the thing which we possess, but the right which we have or claim to have
over the thing. This is as true of the right of ownership as of the right of
servitude and usufruct; and consequently the distinction between the possession
of a thing and the quasi-possession of a right is destitute of foundation.</p>

<p class='c007'>See to the same effect Ihering, Grund des Besitz, p. 159: “Both forms of
possession consist in the exercise of a right (die Ausübung eines Rechts).”
Bruns, also, recognises the figure of speech on which the distinction between
corporeal and incorporeal possession is based. Recht des Besitzes, p. 477.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r252'>252</a>. In saying that possession is the <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i> counterpart of ownership, it is to
be remembered that we use both terms in their widest sense, as including both
the corporeal and incorporeal forms. If we confine our attention to corporeal
ownership and possession, the correspondence between them is incomplete.
Many claims constitute corporeal possession if exercised <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i>, but incorporeal
ownership if recognised <i><span lang="la">de jure</span></i>. Thus tenants, bailees, and pledgees have
corporeal possession but incorporeal ownership. They possess the land or the
chattel, but own merely an encumbrance over it. The ownership of a book
means the ownership of the <em>general or residuary right</em> to it; but the possession
of a book means merely the possession of an <em>exclusive right to it for the time
being</em>. That is to say, the figurative usage of speech is not the same in possession
as in ownership, therefore much corporeal possession is the counterpart of
incorporeal ownership.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r253'>253</a>. Windscheid II. sect. 464: “If we ask what other rights, in addition to real
rights, admit of possession, the answer is that in principle no right is incapable
of possession, which is capable of continuing exercise (dauernde Ausübung).”</p>

<p class='c007'>So Ihering, Grund des Besitz, p. 158: “The conception of possession is
applicable to all rights which admit of realisation (Thatsächlichkeit), that is
to say, which admit of a continuing visible exercise.” Ihering defines possession
generally (p. 160) as “Thatsächlichkeit der mit dauernder Ausübung verbundenen
Rechte.” See also Bruns, Recht des Besitzes, pp. 479, 481.</p>

Australian states are now to be deemed for certain purposes bodies politic and
corporate. For by virtue of Australian legislation they can now sue and be
sued in their own names, and possess other attributes of personality; thus an
action will now lie at the suit of the State of Victoria against the State of
New South Wales. The corporate character thus bestowed upon these states,
however, is concurrent with, and not exclusive of the old common law principle
which identifies the state with the King. Public lands in Australia, for example,
are still the lands of the Crown, except so far as they may be expressly vested
in the corporate state by statute.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r302'>302</a>. Title meant originally a mark, sign, or inscription; <em>e.g.</em>, the title of a
book; <i><span lang="la">titulus sepulchri</span></i>, an epitaph. “Pilate wrote a title and put it on the
cross.” John xix. 19. Thence more specifically it came to mean signs or
evidence of right or ownership; <em>e.g.</em>, <i><span lang="la">titulus</span></i>, a boundary-stone; <i><span lang="la">titulus</span></i>, a title-deed
(Ducange). Thence the <em>ground</em> of right or ownership, viz., an investitive
fact.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f305'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r305'>305</a>. We here use the term transfer in its generic sense, as including both voluntary
and involuntary changes of ownership. It has also a specific sense in
which it includes only the former. Succession <i><span lang="la">ab intestato</span></i>, for example, is a
transfer of rights in the wide sense, but not in the narrow.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f306'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r306'>306</a>. This nomenclature has been suggested and adopted by Sir Frederick
Pollock (Jurisprudence, p. 142). Other writers prefer to indicate acts in the
law by the term juristic acts. The Germans call them Rechtsgeschäfte.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f307'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r307'>307</a>. The use of the terms agreement and contract is curiously unsettled.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>a.</em> Agreement and contract are often used as synonyms, to mean a bilateral
act in the law directed to the creation of an obligation, that is to say a right
<i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>. The objection to this usage is that we cannot afford so to waste
one of these terms.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>b.</em> Contract is sometimes used to mean an agreement (in the preceding sense)
enforceable by law. Pollock, Principles of Contract, p. 8. Indian Contract
Act, sect. 2 (h). This, also, seems the sacrifice of a useful term to an inadequate
purpose. Moreover the distinction does not conform to established usage. We
habitually and conveniently speak of void, invalid, or illegal <em>contracts</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>c.</em> Contract is sometimes used in the wide sense of any bilateral act in the
law. Holland, pp. 225, 226. This, however, is very unusual, and it is certainly
better to use agreement in this sense. Contract, being derived from <i><span lang="la">contrahere</span></i>,
involves the idea of binding two persons together by the <i><span lang="la">vinculum juris</span></i> of an
obligation. An assignment is not a contract, and a release is the very reverse
of a contract.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>d.</em> There remains the usage suggested and adopted in the text. An agreement
is a bilateral act in the law. Est pactio duorum pluriumve in idem
placitum et consensus. D. 2. 14. 1. 2. A contract, on the other hand, is that
particular kind of agreement which is intended to create a right <i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>
between the parties. This is the distinction adopted by Sir W. Anson in his
work on Contracts, p. 2: “Contract is that form of agreement which directly
contemplates and creates an obligation.” So Pothier, Traité des Obligations,
sect. 3; L’espèce de convention qui a pour objet de former quelque engagement
est celle qu’on appelle contrat. <cite>Cf.</cite> French Civil Code, Art. 1101. The
Germans use <cite>Vertrag</cite> as equivalent to agreement in this sense; while a contract
is <i><span lang="la">obligatorischer Vertrag</span></i>, or <cite>Vertrag</cite> in a narrower sense. Savigny, System,
sect. 141. Puchta, sect. 271. Dernburg, Pandekten, I. sect. 92.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f309'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r309'>309</a>. The terms unilateral and bilateral possess another signification distinct
from that which is attributed to them in the text. In the sense there adopted
all agreements are bilateral, but there is another sense in which some of them
are bilateral and others unilateral. An agreement is bilateral, in this latter
signification, if there is something <em>to be done</em> by each party to it, while it is
unilateral if one party is purely passive and free from legal obligation, all the
activity and obligation being on the other side. An agreement to lend money
is bilateral, while an agreement to give money is unilateral.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r327'>327</a>. The distinction between material and formal wrongdoing has long been
familiar in moral philosophy. The material badness of an act depends on the
actual nature, circumstances, and consequences of it. Its formal badness
depends on the state of mind or will of the actor. The madman who kills his
keeper offends materially but not formally; so also with him who in invincible
ignorance breaks the rule of right. Material without formal wrongdoing is no
ground of culpability.</p>

which the captain of a German steamer was tried in England for manslaughter
by negligently sinking an English ship in the Channel and drowning one of
the passengers. One of the minor questions in the case was that of the place
in which the offence was committed. Was it on board the English ship, or on
board the German steamer, or on board neither of them? Four of the judges
of the Court for Crown Cases Reserved, namely, Denman, J., Bramwell, B.,
Coleridge, C.J., and Cockburn, C.J., agreed that if the offence had been
wilful homicide it would have been committed on the English ship. Denman, J.,
and Coleridge, C.J., applied the same rule to negligent homicide. Cockburn,
C.J., doubted as to negligent homicide. Bramwell, B., said (p. 150): “If the
act was wilful, it is done where the will intends it should take effect; aliter
when it is negligent.” For a further discussion of the matter, see Stephen’s
History of Criminal Law, II. pp. 9–12, and Oppenhoff’s annotated edition of the
German Criminal Code (13th ed. 1896), p. 28. The German doctrine is that
an act is committed in the place where it is begun. See also Terry, Principles

follows that there are cases in which a man may commit a wrong after his
death. If A. excavates his own land so as to cause, after an interval, the subsidence
of the adjoining land of B., there is no wrong done until the subsidence
happens; <cite>Backhouse</cite> v. <cite>Bonomi</cite>, 9 H. L. C. 503; <cite>Darley Main Colliery Co.</cite> v.

results from culpable inadvertence (<span lang="de">Unaufmerksamkeit</span>) or indifference
(<span lang="de">Gleichgultigkeit</span>). The mental attitude of the wrongdoer consists not in any
desire to do harm, but in the absence of a sufficient desire to avoid it. The
law is not satisfied with the mere absence of any intention to inflict injury,
but demands a positive direction of the will towards the avoidance of it.”</p>

Bowen: “If the case had been tried with a jury, the judge would have pointed
out to them that gross negligence might amount to evidence of fraud, if it
were so gross as to be incompatible with the idea of honesty, but that even
gross negligence, in the absence of dishonesty, did not of itself amount to
fraud.” Literally read, this implies that, though gross negligence cannot <em>be</em>
fraud, it may be <em>evidence</em> of it, but this of course is impossible. If two things
are inconsistent with each other, one of them cannot be evidence of the other.

<div class='footnote' id='f416'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r416'>416</a>. It is only by slow degrees and with imperfect consistency that our law
has worked out an intelligible principle on this matter. The older law seems
to have recognised mere physical attachment as necessary and sufficient,
subject to exceptions so numerous and important, as to deprive the principle
itself of any rational basis. See, for the modern law on the point, <cite>Holland</cite> v.
<cite>Hodgson</cite>, L. R. 7 C. P. 328; <cite>Monti</cite> v. <cite>Barnes</cite>, (1901) 1 K. B. 205; <cite>In re De Falbe</cite>,

Similar law is contained in Article 95 of the German Civil Code: “Things are
not part of the land which are attached to it simply for a temporary purpose.”
The case of <cite>Reynolds</cite> v. <cite>Ashby &#38; Son</cite>, (1904) A. C. 466, shows, however, that
English law has not yet succeeded in adopting with consistency any single and
intelligible rule.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f417'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r417'>417</a>. Unlike a chattel, a piece of land has no natural boundaries. Its separation
from the adjoining land is purely arbitrary and artificial, and it is capable of
subdivision and separate ownership to any extent that may be desired. The
lines of subdivision are usually vertical, but may be horizontal. The surface
of land, for example, may belong to one man and the substrata to another.
Each story of a house may have a different owner. In <cite>The Midland Railway
Coy.</cite> v. <cite>Wright</cite>, (1901) 1 Ch. 738, it was held that a right had been acquired by
prescription to the surface of land belonging to a railway company, although a
tunnel beneath the surface remained the property of the company as having
been continuously in its occupation.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f423'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r423'>423</a>. There are certain cases, however, which have been decided on the assumption
that incorporeal property possesses no local situation at all. For this
reason it was held in <cite>The Smelting Company of Australia</cite> v. <cite>Commissioners of
Inland Revenue</cite>, (1897) 1 Q. B. 172, that a share of a New South Wales patent,
together with the exclusive right of using it within a certain district of that
colony, was not property “locally situated out of the United Kingdom” within
the meaning of sect. 59, sub-sect. 1, of the Stamp Act, 1891. “I do not see,”
says Lopes, L.J., at p. 181, “how a share in a patent, or a licence to use a
patent, which is not a visible or tangible thing, can be said to be locally situate
anywhere.” See, however, as to this case, the observations of Vaughan
Williams, L.J., in <cite>Muller &#38; Co.’s Margarine, Limited</cite>, v. <cite>Inland Revenue Commissioners</cite>,
(1900) 1 Q. B. at p. 322, and of Lord Lindley on appeal in the House
of Lords, (1901) A. C. at p. 237. See further, as to the local situation of incorporeal
property. <cite>Danubian Sugar Factories</cite> v. <cite>Commissioners of Inland Revenue</cite>,

<div class='footnote' id='f425'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r425'>425</a>. Under the head of material things we must class the <em>qualities</em> of matter, so
far as they are capable in law of being in themselves the objects of rights.
The qualities which thus admit of separate legal appropriation are two in
number, namely force and space. Electricity is in law a chattel, which can be
owned, sold, stolen, and otherwise rightfully and wrongfully dealt with.
45 &#38; 46 Vict. c. 56, s. 23. Definite portions of empty space are capable of
appropriation and ownership, no less than the material objects with
which other portions of space are filled. The interior of my house is as
much mine as are the walls and the roof. It is commonly said that the owner
of land owns also the space above the surface <i><span lang="la">usque ad coelum</span></i>. Whether
this is truly so is a doubtful point as the law stands, but there is no theoretical
difficulty in allowing the validity of such a claim to the ownership of empty
space.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f426'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r426'>426</a>. The distinction formerly noticed by us (§ 88) between <em>corporeal</em> and <em>incorporeal</em>
things must not be confounded with the present distinction between
<em>material</em> and <em>immaterial</em> things. The latter is a logical distinction, but the
former is a mere artifice of speech. An incorporeal thing is a kind of right,
namely any right which is not identified with some material thing which is its
subject-matter. An immaterial thing is not a right but the subject-matter of
one. It is any subject-matter of a right except a material object.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r429'>429</a>. Encumbrances are not confined to the law of property, but pertain to the
law of obligations also. Choses in action may be mortgaged, settled in trust,
or otherwise made the subject-matter of <i><span lang="la">jura in re aliena</span></i>, no less than land
and chattels. Much, therefore, of what is to be said here touching the nature
of the different forms of encumbrance is equally applicable to the law of rights
<i><span lang="la">in personam</span></i>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f430'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r430'>430</a>. Possession by way of <i><span lang="la">security</span></i> only, <em>e.g.</em>, a pledge, is differentiated by its
purpose, however, and falls within the class of securities, not within that of
leases.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f432'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r432'>432</a>. An example of a lease in perpetuity is the emphyteusis of Roman law. In
consequence of its perpetuity the Roman lawyers were divided in opinion as to
the true position of the tenant or <i><span lang="la">emphyteuta</span></i>, some regarding him as an owner
and others as an encumbrancer. The law was finally settled in the latter sense.
Just. Inst. III. 24. 3.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f433'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r433'>433</a>. The term servitude (<i><span lang="la">servitus</span></i>) is derived from Roman law, and has scarcely
succeeded in obtaining recognition as a technical term of English law. It is
better, however, than the English <em>easement</em>, inasmuch as easements are in the
strict sense only one class of servitudes as above defined.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f434'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r434'>434</a>. It is only over land that servitudes can exist. Land is of such a nature as
to admit readily of non-possessory uses, whereas the use of a chattel usually
involves the possession of it for the time being, however brief that time may
be. The non-possessory use of chattels, even when it exists, is not recognised
by the law as an encumbrance of the ownership, so as to run with it into the
hands of assignees.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f435'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r435'>435</a>. An easement, in the strictest sense, means a particular kind of servitude,
namely a private and appurtenant servitude which is not a right to take any
<em>profit</em> from the servient land. A right of way or of light or of support is an
easement; but a right to pasture cattle or to dig for minerals is in English
law a distinct form of servitude known as a profit. This distinction is unknown
in other systems, and it has no significance in juridical theory. Its practical importance
lies in the rule that an easement must (it seems) be appurtenant, while
a profit may be either appurtenant or in gross.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f436'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r436'>436</a>. The term security is also used in a wider sense to include not only securities
over property, but also the contract of suretyship or guarantee—a mode of
ensuring the payment of a debt by the addition of a second and accessory debtor,
from whom payment may be obtained on default of the principal debtor. With
this form of security we are not here concerned, since it pertains not to the law
of property, but to that of obligations.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f437'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r437'>437</a>. The word lien has not succeeded in attaining any fixed application as a
technical term of English law. Its use is capricious and uncertain, and we are
at liberty, therefore, to appropriate it for the purpose mentioned in the text, <em>i.e.</em>,
to include all forms of security except mortgages.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f438'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r438'>438</a>. As we shall see, a mortgage by way of transfer is none the less an encumbrance
also—an encumbrance, that is to say, of the beneficial ownership which
remains vested in the mortgagor.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f439'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r439'>439</a>. It is not essential to a mortgage that the right vested in the mortgagee
should in actual fact survive the right secured by it, so as to remain outstanding
and redeemable. It is sufficient that in its nature it should be capable of
doing so, and therefore requires to be artificially restricted by an obligation
or condition of re-assignment or surrender. This re-assignment or surrender
may be effected by act of the law, no less than by the act of the mortgagee.
The conveyance of the fee simple of land by way of security is necessarily a
mortgage and not a lien, whether it revests in the mortgagor <i><span lang="la">ipso jure</span></i> on the
payment of the debt, or does not revest until the mortgagee has executed a
deed of reconveyance.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f440'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r440'>440</a>. This is one of the reforms effected by the Torrens system of real property
law in force in the Australasian colonies. The so-called mortgages of land
under that system are in reality merely liens.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f441'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r441'>441</a>. Applications of the rule of possessory ownership may be seen in the cases
of <cite>Armory</cite> v. <cite>Delamirie</cite>, 1 Str. 504; 1 Smith, L. C. 343; <cite>Asher</cite> v. <cite>Whitlock</cite>,

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f442'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r442'>442</a>. The term prescription (<i><span lang="la">praescriptio</span></i>) has its origin in Roman law. It meant
originally a particular part of the <i><span lang="la">formula</span></i> or written pleadings in a law suit—that
portion, namely, which was written first (<i><span lang="la">praescriptum</span></i>) by way of a preliminary
objection on the part of the defendant. <i><span lang="la">Praescriptio fori</span></i>, for example,
meant a preliminary plea to the jurisdiction of the court. So <i><span lang="la">praescriptio longi
temporis</span></i> was a plea that the claim of the plaintiff was barred by lapse of time.
Hence, by way of abbreviation and metonymy (other forms of prescription
being forgotten) prescription in the modern sense.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f443'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r443'>443</a>. It is clear, however, that until a debt or other obligation is actually due
and enforceable, no presumption against its validity can arise through the
lapse of time. Therefore prescription runs, not from the day on which the
obligation first arises, but from that on which it first becomes enforceable.

<p class='c007'><a href='#r449'>449</a>. Continental systems carry much further than our own the doctrine that
the possessor of a chattel may confer a good title to it. Article 2279 of the
French Civil Code lays down the general principle that <i><span lang="fr">En fait de meubles la
possession vaut titre</span></i>. In other words the ownership of a chattel involves no <i><span lang="fr">droit
de suite</span></i> or <i><span lang="la">jus sequelae</span></i>, no right of following the thing into the hands of third
persons who have obtained it in good faith. The rule, however, is subject to
important exceptions, for it does not apply either to chattels stolen or to
chattels lost. Speaking generally, therefore, it is applicable only where an
owner has voluntarily entrusted the possession of the thing to some one else,
as a pledgee, borrower, depositee, or agent, who has wrongfully disposed of it
to some third person. Baudry-Lacantinerie, De la Prescription, ch. 20. See
also, for very similar law, the German Civil Code, sects. 932–935, and the
Italian Civil Code, sects. 707–708.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f462'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r462'>462</a>. It is advisable to point out that the obligation to pay damages for a breach
of contract is itself to be classed as contractual, no less than the original obligation
to perform the contract.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f463'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r463'>463</a>. A similar relation exists between breaches of contract and crimes. Breach
of contract is not in itself a crime, any more than it is in itself a tort; yet by
undertaking a contractual duty, a man may often put himself in such a position,
that he cannot break the duty without causing such damage to third
persons, as will create criminal liability. For example, a signalman’s breach
of his contractual duty to attend to the signals may amount to the crime of
manslaughter if a fatal accident results from it.</p>

legislate or to issue special orders on every subject whatever.” Brown,

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
